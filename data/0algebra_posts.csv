464167,"Hey, guys. I've been on the phone with ALEKS with the same questions. Here are the answers:

@Anonymous: Each course is completely self-contained and has its own course code. You have to purchase a separate license for each course you're enrolled in. There is, unfortunately, no way around this.

@Heather and Jack: You need to follow the following steps:

1) Get the course's course code from the Coursera syllabus, then go to www.ALEKS.com to register. 

2) Once on the ALEKS site, choose ""Higher Education"" from either the menu bar or the three large colored boxes at the bottom of the home page.

3) Next, choose ""Sign Up Now"" from the small box on the right. On the next (Sign Up) page, enter the Coursera course code into the fields provided in the orange box on the left. Clicking ""Continue"" will bring you to a page entitled ""Confirm Enrollment Information."" Click ""Continue if the course information is correct (the names are not identical to the Coursera names; just be sure it says ""Algebra"" for this course and ""Precalculus"" for the Precalculus course).

4) On the ""Welcome to ALEKS!"" page, choose the appropriate option and click ""Continue.""

5) If you've never used ALEKS before and choose the option ""I have never used ALEKS before or I do not have an ALEKS login name,"" you'll be brought to a page titled ""Enter Your Access Code."" This is different from the course code; this is effectively your subscription. If you haven't used ALEKS before, you'll need to purchase a subscription. 

6) Click the link that says ""purchase an access code online."" Choose the length of subscription you want (you'll need at least 11 weeks) and then enter your registration information on the page that follows.

I haven't gotten beyond that point, as I haven't yet decided whether or not to purchase a subscription. But hopefully this should get you navigating the site so you can come back to this point (or one of the earlier steps) if necessary.

:)  Nicole

He agreed with me that it's a little outrageous to have the main bulk of a free course in a paid program. Sure, we have the option of not buying it, but not buying the program—where all the practice problems, the textbook chapters, and the assessments are—is a little like signing up for a course and being allowed to go to the lectures and take all the tests, but not being allowed to have the textbook or the homework problems. 

It would be one thing if this was advertised as a paid course and the fees upfront, but it's rather unfair to those of us who have signed up for a free course because we're financially challenged.

****SPOILER ALERT!! DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS LINE IF YOU HAVEN'T ATTEMPTED THE QUIZ FOR  MULTIPLICATION INVOLVING SQUARE ROOTS  ON YOUR OWN YET. ****     

So  the problem was (2*sqrt(7)+3*sqrt(2))*(sqrt(7)-5*sqrt(2))
So I foiled and got
First : +14
Outer : -10*sqrt(14)
Inner :+ 3*sqrt(14)
Last : -30
I simplified that by adding 14 and -30 and then also adding -10*sqrt(14) 3*sqrt(14), ending up with -16 - 7*sqrt(14) which is the answer that I have entered multiple times in various ways.  Am I making a mathematical error or just typing it in wrong?",257,20,1359419714

Take the initial ALEKS assessment for INtermediate Algebra and if you score above 75-85 percent, you're ready for Precalc, but if not, you may want to complete Intermediate Algebra course first (or you could take the ALEKS Precalculus assessment and if you score much below 10 percent you'll want to take Intermediate Algebra).

You won't have to pay extra because you don't buy courses in ALEKS, you buy time.

  Just try to think simple. You need not evaluate the exponents of x, y and z for Question 1. All it asks is k which is the constant or coefficient. So evaluate (4/6)^-2. Since this is raising to negative exponent, get the reciprocal and do the positive exponent. You end up with (6/4)^2. Evaluate this and then simplify. Enter the solution as a fraction.

For instance, I just wrote you a lengthy response but then switched tabs to check something, came back and the page automatically reloaded itself and I lost all I wrote.  Ack!  That should not happen Apple!

Anyway, firstly, you can download all the lectures to your computer if you go to the""video lecture index"" at left.  Next to each lecture link are three icons, click the rightmost one.  That should get you by.  Your browsers may be set to block pop ups wich it might be reading the videos as??

For you ipad troubles...it may be a storage/memory issue like if your iPad is packed with photos, videos, and apps.  You can check on that status in your settings under ""usage"".

Anyone else miffed because we still don't know the answer to the age-old question: ""How many licks does it take to get to the center. . .""?

In the lecture we are shown how to solve how long it would take to get to the end, not how many licks. . .
Although technically speaking the owl did tell us the answer, just not how to solve it.  

I just don't want to cheat. ;-)

And last I checked I don't have a beak.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Watch the video
2. Observe the shift from licks to length of time
3. Ponder the wonders of the universe.

I have spoken to 2 representatives at Coursera, who mentioned that the McGraw Hill site which handles the registration payments can be 'sensitve and temperamental' and that things like hyphens between phone numbers, etc. can cause problems.  However, beyond that I did not get much joy.

So next call was to McGraw Hill at 001-877-833-5524 where the agent was rather defensive about their website.  She advised that their technical department has said that Firefox is sometimes better than Windows Explorer for data entry acceptance!  So clearly McGraw Hill are slightly limited on that front.  When I asked the agent whether having a UK e-mail address could be causing problems, she advised that she was not sure, since most of the student registrations she dealt with were USA based.  In fairness, she did offer to try and register me over the phone, but I declined, since I want to think about this first and she was not even sure it would work via her terminal.

It would be nice if someone administering the course at Irvine was able to comment on this problem, since it appears quite widespread for students outside the USA.  This cannot be the first time they have encountered this issue, at least at Coursera.  There are only so many times one can mess around with billing systems which belong in the last century! :-D",743,8,1359488258

The 4th example shows x >= -2 so that one is a positive infinity sign, so it doesn't make sense that the 3rd example would also be a positive infinity sign.

Does anyone have a better way to explain this so I can grasp this concept better?

That said, it constantly amazes me that some people will think that because a thing is free, every single item mentioned must also be free. Even more, it baffles me that people will, when taking a free class offered out of the good will of the Professors and administration involved for, as I said, FREE, will still find some reason to complain about it. To them I say: You are under no obligation to take the class. If you are offended that the professors recommend a learning accesory that costs money, go to OpenCourseware. There are many excellent courses available, and nobody will suggest you spend a dime on anything.

But if you want a guided, assisted program of study, this is the place to be. And yes, the professors recommend ALEKS, because it is very high quality software structured for a classroom environment. My wife used it at the local community college. I won't, because I can't afford it. But the key word here is RECOMMEND. I recommend buying a shop manual every time you buy a car. Does that mean you have ot do it? No. Does that mean I'm in Haynes Publications' pocket? No. It simply means I want you to get the most out of your vehicle. You don't like it, don't do it. But for god's sake, don't go spouting off political conspiracy theories or demanding that the professors never be allowed to suggest anything that might cost a little money. It doesn't do any good, and only serves to label you as a whiner and complainer. And nobody likes whiners and complainers. The class is free, and because it is free none of us has the right to demand any more of it than those who make the class possible have offered.

1451765,"Hello,
I just finished my ALEKS assessment for the actual Coursera course today, AFTER signing up on Sunday (in anticipation), with only ALEKS courses available, and doing the whole 5 hour assessment Sunday, but had to do all over again (after figuring out how to get signed up through McGraw-Hill). I have issues with the lack of clear directions in this respect, but stumbled upon your post and decided to try to offer you some encouragement, particularly since you seem to have the desire to learn that which scares you, that which pleases me so. I am trying to relearn basic math concepts I didn't learn properly a long time agol

I can feel your panic and believe I understand the cause. You are signed up under ALEKS, which is like being taught by a robot (Artificial Intelligence engine drives the assessment, pushing you through a knowledge space), however, it is supposedly much better than not using ALEKS because ALEKS watches over your learning process and moves you along teaching you what you need to know next, at each step.

If you can RELAX (take a deep breath and let all of your worries go away), then slowly do what ALEKS tells you to do, step by careful step. ALEKS keeps testing you until you show good evidence that you fully understand each concept before letting you move along, then it selects the fastest path from where you are to where you need to go to get all of the information from this course. Forget trying to be the best student in the class because it is hopeless (there are so many students taking it!). Give yourself a pat on the back each time you learn a new segment, and tell yourself that you will learn what you will learn, and be happy with that.

Net result, you will indeed learn a lot of neat math skills that you never thought you could, and you will be proud of that accomplishment. It doesn't matter how well you actually do, in comparison with others. It only matters that you learn to LIKE math.

So think of a set of scales with nothing on them, you will notice both sides of the scale will be even. Now say you place a bag of sugar on one side of the scale, the scale with the sugar will tip down so now the scale is no longer even or equal in weight to the other scale. Now in order to make the scale even we must either place a bag of sugar to the other scale or remove the sugar completely to make the scale equal (true)

2461522,"Paulo, the problem is the length of the circle, or circumference, is given by the formula $$C = 2\pi r$$.  So as you can see, the circumference also depends on $$\pi$$ and so there is a deeper problem than at first glance.  Moreover, a rational number is a fraction $$\frac{p}{q}$$, but there is an additional clause.  Namely that $$p, q$$ are integers and that $$ q \neq 0$$.  I can take an irrational number, say $$\sqrt{2}$$ and make the number $$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$ and even though it looks like a fraction it is still not rational because it does not meet the above criterion.  This idea is seen the ""Set of Real Numbers"" quiz.

As an aside, it is not very easy to *prove* that $$\pi$$ is irrational (see: [Proof][1]), but just because something derives from a division does not mean it is rational.

2461522,"As Conor says, the problem is that $$\sqrt{5}$$ cannot be expressed as $$\frac{x}{y}$$ for two integers $$x, y$$ where $$y \neq 0$$.  It is true that $$2.2360679$$ is a rational number, i.e. look at $$\frac{22360679}{10000000} = 2.2360679$$.  The problem is that $$\sqrt{5}$$ isn't exactly $$2.2360679$$; that is an approximation to $$\sqrt{5}$$.  If I wanted to look a bit closer, I would see that $$2.2360679775$$ is a better approximation to $$\sqrt{5}$$.  And if I wanted to look even closer, I could find an even better approximation.  Essentially an irrational number is one that behaves like this.  I can always make my approximation for $$\sqrt{5}$$ better and better, but I will never get the ""true"" value of $$\sqrt{5}$$.  There's always more hidden information that I don't know about it.  This is different than a repeating decimal, because once I find where it repeats, I essentially know all the information about the number.  Once I know this, I can write it as a rational fraction, like $$\frac{1}{3} = .3333 \ldots$$ or $$\frac{17}{99} = .171717 \dots$$",929,96,1359514910

Happy times are here during week 3 for those who have had problems with syntax.

Week 3 - Quiz 1 - Four questions.  Four numerical answers to be inputted.
Week 3 - Quiz 2 - Three questions.  One number to be entered and two multiple choice questions.
Week 3 - Quiz 3 - One numerical answer and two multiple choice questions.

Number of syntax inquiries this week should be the { } (the emply set)**


**News Flash -- Sat Feb 09 - I have just posted a quick summary for week 2 syntax at https://class.coursera.org/algebra-001/forum/thread?thread_id=577**

**Note - Due to the length of this thread, I have started a new thread for comments about parsing and syntax for Week 2 at https://class.coursera.org/algebra-001/forum/thread?thread_id=414**

Have been monitoring these discussions for the past few days.  A number of people appear to be spending a long time trying to get the system to accept their answers to quizzes.  These are popping up all over the place, so I am trying to provide a single spot to address these errors.

I have set up this forum to do the following:

1.  Each week I will go through the quizzes and give examples of how to enter answers in the system.

2.  If you have a syntax error that you cannot resolve, you can post your expression here (please don't post the quiz you are talking about) and I am sure someone will respond to it.

3.  I will monitor this thread to see how things progress.

OK, I am going to write up a Word document for Week 1 which I will post here.

In threads, it is so much easier to use Word which has an equation editor and then paste here.

Should not take too long!!.

Two hours later.  Here is what I came up with.  Hope it can be helpful to some.

Help for Syntax and Parsing Expressions for Week 1

1.  BEDMAS

First, as in your regular high school math, computer systems analyze mathematical expressions using the BEDMAS rule.

B – Any expressions within brackets are evaluated first.  You will see that in an example later.

E – Any expressions involving exponents are evaluated next.

D and M  - Division and multiplication are done in the order in which they occur

A and S – Addition and subtraction are done in the order in which they occur.

One example:  Evaluate:  (5(2+3^2))/13= (5(2+9))/13=(5(11))/13=55/13

2.   Implied Multiplication Between a Cofficient and a Variable

2xy must be entered as 2*xy where 2 is a coefficient and x is a variable.  Interesting that no asterisk is required between the x and y        

3.  Entering Real Numbers:
 55/13 is entered as 55/13.  It is probably best to leave all real number answers in the form a/b and when answering quiz questions enter a/b. 
 
We know 3/4 = .75.  Will the system accept .75?  Not sure; I would use the fraction form.  The real problem arises with numbers like 1/3 which is a repeating decimal.

4.  Entering Radical Expressions

√x  is entered as sqrt(x) or as x^(1/2) 

cube root of x  is entered as x^(1/3) or root(x,3)

-4ab^5 cube root of (ab^2 ) is entered as -4*ab^5*(a*b^2)^(1/3) or -4*ab^5*root((ab^2),3)

3√x	is entered as 3*sqrt(x)
    
3-2√5 is entered as 3-2*sqrt(5)


5.  More on Entering Radical Expressions

I was surprised that when I entered an expression such as 3-2√5 and previewed it, it showed up as -2√5+3.  I have never seen that before, but I said to myself “not to worry!!”, a+b = b+a for real numbers (commutativity), so those two expressions are the same.

5.  Fractional Exponents:

If you are asked to evaluate a power such as (〖16/9)〗^(3/2)  (this looked so nice in Word!!) and you use your calculator, the calculator will give you 2.370370370... which is not going to be accepted as a quiz answer.

If you evaluate the power by first taking the square root and then cubing your answer, you will get 64/27.

64/27 = 2.370370370 but the system marking the quizzes will be happy (i.e. you earn a mark!) only when you enter the fraction 64/27.

Well, that took longer than I thought – two hours!!  Haven’t used the equation editor in a long time.

2369303,"I solved it like this:

(-8/27) ^ 2/3 is the start.

To choose which way to go, look at the numbers. 8^2 and 27^2 will be relatively large numbers, you'd then have to ^1/3 ... also, 8 and 27 are both cubed numbers, which means they would solve nicely when ^1/3 -ed.

So the smart step is to eliminate the 1/3 cube first and bring the 2 squared in later, this looks as follows: (- 8^(1/3) / 27^(1/3) ) ^2

That turns into (- 2/3) ^2 and to solve that is an easy one. Or is it? The tricky part is, that the minus is dropped because of the squaring (if that is a word).

Explanation: -2 * -2 = 4 ---> so -2 ^2 != -4 ---> but -2 ^2 = 4.

That's why finally the (- 2/3) ^2 ... which is (-2 ^2 / -3 ^2) ... turns into (4 / 9)

Somethings that I noticed differently in my work from yours are below. I'm not sure if my work is in fact correct but here it is so you can learn from my mistake/or correct answer... and someone can hopefully help me:

**In Your Numerator:** 5*sqrt3+15+-2*sqrt3+2/3+-sqrt3-sqrt3+1

5*sqrt3 should be 5*sqrt9 because when you go to foil you multiply 5*sqrt3 by sqrt3 and the two sqrt3 combine into sqrt9. sqrt9 can also become just 3 because of when you take it out of the square root. Once you square root 9, you can then multiply 5 x 3 = 15. *FINAL Numerator:* 13 - 3*sqrt3

**In Your Denominator:** 3+-sqrt3-sqrt3+1

I have 3 + (sqrt3) + (-sqrt3) + (-1) which becomes 3 - 1 = 2 (your *FINAL Denominator*) once you cancel out the positive and negative sqrt3

I like to take the pre-calculus course which is concurrently offered with the intermediate algebra course and by the same instructors. But I feel I couldn't handle both at the same time while I work full time and have a family to support. And considering my math ability, I don't think I'll be able to handle both final exams at the same time anyway.So can I enroll in the pre-calculus and do all the quizzes, assignments and exam at a later date or after the intermediate algebra course is over? 

I don't understand why the instructors and their team offer these two courses at the same time when I think it is logical to do one after the other as it should be. I am sure they have good reason(s) for doing this.

Don't forget mathematics is really a language, and like language learning some rote learning is totally unavoidable. You have to associate arbitrary symbols with concepts (i.e. words with something they do). At least in mathematics you can see why a mathematical rule works and often why it's called what it's called, whereas if you're learning a foreign language it's often completely arbitrary. However, as you go through this first week you'll find that the topics covered by the video lectures on the various rules and it makes more sense and as you work through the problems it'll help re-inforce these rules as you actually go and use them. The properties (such as the commutive, associative, distributive etc) are a foundation that you need to understand *why* you do the things you do in the later lessons.

University courses (regardless of the level) also expect the student to go off and research on their own a bit. The videos are pointers and introduction to the things you'll need to know, just like I remember from my university lectures (I didn't study mathematics at university level, but I imagine it's the same). Use them to know what to search for in Google. There are good articles on the properties introduced in the 1st lecture around the internet which are very enlightening. Treat the videos as introductions and pointers to where to look next and you'll be fine.

The basic idea is to simplify the expression on the left hand side, and then the numbers you get for coefficient and exponents correspond to the letters k, s, r, t. In the example, your simplified expression is (yz)/(3x^2) - shown at the bottom - so k = 1/3, n = 1, m = 1, and s = 2. It's easier to make it harder than it's supposed to be :)

Ex 3: Simplify   
The example starts with $$5\sqrt{24}-4\sqrt{32}+3\sqrt{18}-2\sqrt{54}$$  
By definition,    
$$\sqrt{}$$ is the RADICAL    
2 is the DEGREE, because it is a Square Root, and    
24 is considered to be the RADICAND.   

But, towards the end of the video around 05:40, while combining similar items, it was mentioned that $$\sqrt{6}$$ and $$\sqrt{2}$$ have different RADICALS and therefore, they cannot be combined.
However, I believe that both $$\sqrt{6}$$ and $$\sqrt{2}$$ have the same RADICALS (DEGREE of 2) but still cannot be combined due to having different RADICANDS.

It may also seem blurrier when ctrl-- to get back to the orig size? Not sure if that aspect was imagined or real.

In any event, I got the answers right on the 4th try... I'm pretty certain I gave the same (wrong) answers for try #2 and #3, perhaps #1,but I think I plain got that wrong completely. The problems with tries 2 & 3 were that I read the small print as:

((4x^3 * y^5 * z^-2) / (6y^-5 * z^5 * x^-8)) ^-3

ie: I confused the outer exponent of -2 for -3 so I got the answers wrong at least (and probably only, because for all of the first 3 tries, I read it as -3 but the first try I am fairly certain I didn't do the operations correctly) for 2 of the 4 tries due to that.

2046977,"Hint:
The problem started with: 0.0000075    
It is a positive number.   
This number will always remain positive even when you convert and represent it in a Sci notation. The $$10^{-6}$$ does not mean that the number itself should change sign from positive to negative.   
Also, as the video mentioned:   
When you move the decimal to the right, the power to the 10 becomes negative, such as, $$10^{negative}$$.    
When you move the decimal to the left, the power to the 10 becomes positive, such as, $$10^{positive}$$.    
So,   
move right = $$10^{negative}$$       
move left   = $$10^{positive}$$

The first course I took on Coursera was Introduction to Mathematical Thinking. LaTeX was used throughout, as is also used here in the Discussion Forums. I've since learned LaTeX and it has worked consistently once you know how it works. Looking at the discussions under this course, we are all spending too much effort on inputting answers rather than learning.

Right now I'm stuck in Quiz 3 Q1 because I can't get the system to write a fraction the way I want it. I might find the solution if I read through enough of Discussions. But I would rather spend that time doing some actual learning.

Therefore, if $$b$$ is positive, i.e., $$+b$$, then the expression would look something like this:

$$f(1) = {b}^1 = b$$

$$ f(2) = {b}^2 = b \times b$$

$$f(3) = {b}^3 = b \times b \times b$$

If $$b$$ is a negative number, such that it is $$ - b$$, the expression becomes something like this:

$$f(1) = (-b)^1 = (- b)$$

$$ f(2) = (-b)^2 = (- b) \times (- b)$$

$$f(3) = (-b)^3 = (- b) \times (- b) \times (- b)$$

When a negative number is multiplied by another negative number, the resulting expression becomes positive, hence for any even value of $$n$$, $$b$$ cannot ever be a negative number. $$b$$ may only be a negative number if $$n$$ is not even (Such as the value of $$1$$ and $$3$$).

What helped me was really reviewing the ""How to enter math expressions"" (green on the left).
I had the same problem with Rationalizing the Denominator.  Now I got it right by realizing you multiply the ""outer"" exponent times the ""inner"" exponent. (multiply the one outside the bracket by the one inside the bracket, don't do the exponent to the nth power.)

To be considered irrational number one, it is necessary that it can not be written as a / b where a and b are integers different from zero and b. In other words, you can not write an irrational number as a fraction. Another feature of irrational numbers is that the party never ends and decimal digits never repeat immediately. For example the number pi is 3.14159365 .... Root 4 is rational because equals 2, because the root of 5 is 2.23606 .... whose party never ends and its decimal digits never repeat in succession.

1846811,"Just wanted to share my initial experience with ALEKS as it relates to this course.  While my situation *may* be unique I believe that there are other folks out there with similar Algebra proficiency as myself.  So far I have found ALEKS a great tool to work on building my Algebra proficiency back up to the level required by this course, however, I have not found it to be an adequate tool to prepare me for the quizzes (which even as an ALEKS user the 'Getting Started' info states you still have to take).  I'm not sure how the ALEKS work being done will contribute to my overall grade, there seems to be some confusing information in the Syllabus & Getting Started info), but having completed 34 of the 106 topics has left me sorely lacking in preparation for the material being presented in this week's section.  Additionally the work to be done in ALEKS is grouped in two week chunks but work for weeks 1 and 2 is due by next Wednesday (2/6) a mere 10 days into the class and three days after this week's quizzes are due to be completed.

This lack of connection to the material being presented may be because I require serious remediation which ALEKS is addressing, however the sheer volume of material I have to cover is staggering.  So far I have spent a little over 7 hours this week working in ALEKS and have only completed 32% of the topics that are required to be finished by next Wednesday (for this course).  This in and of itself would not be completely impossible to achieve however very little of the material I have covered in ALEKS relates to the weekly quizzes (that are still required) so I have found myself going back, watching the videos, searching for clarification & more information to support the successful completion of the quizzes and completing the weekly required quizzes on the Coursera website.

At this point I feel fairly daunted with the amount of time that I will be investing (if things continue on this way) in this course and am not sure I have the bandwidth (not to mention wherewithal) to continue.  Even if I do I worry that I will not be developing a deep understanding of the subject matter while plowing through so much in such a short period of time.

**TL;DR** - Had I known then what I know now: before I spent $50 on an ALEKS license, I would have dropped the course, utilized some of the other resources on the internet (Khan Academy) and then potentially re-registered for the course once offered again.

**Feedback for the instructors:** I would suggest tempering your recommendation of ALEKS for all enrolled students and having some sort of proficiency expectation (an assessment tool would be awesome) to help future potential students determine if their existing Algebra skills support the material presented in this course.",2008,337,1359783841

2272556,"PLEASE step in if I am giving out any misinformation, I have only gotten through #3 and I didn't get it right first try either...
The issue, if I understood it is about how to apply the negative exponent rule to an existing fraction?

e.g.   (7/8)^-4

If you apply the rule, you get:  (1/(7/8)^4)  i.e. 1 over (7/8) to the *positive* 4th power.

How you clean up this mess (and this is a simple example compared to the quiz) is using the fact that you can always safely apply an ""identity"" rule (AGAIN - please someone step in if I am mistaken in this approach) because if you multiply something by 1, you really aren't changing anything, if you follow:

7/8 * 8/8 = 56/64, which of course reduces to 7/8. Um, but what then is the point of multiplying by (the equivalent of) 1?

Fractions as numerator/denominators.
If it was instead:
1 / (7/8) and you multiplied it by 8/8...

7/8 * 8 can be thought of as 7/8 * 8/1 (identity stuff again, this time for division), which is 7*8 / 8 * 1, which becomes 56/8, which becomes just 7. And of course the numerator multiplies as 1 * 8 == 8. So the answer becomes:
8 / 7.

Base concept:  2  =   2/1     (Identity Property of Division? wasn't specifically mentioned but + is paired with - and * with / for most (all?) rules I can think of)

Which means  5 * 2 = 5 * (2/1) and if we want to change this to division without changing the result, we would use that I-don't-know-rule to replace mult number with its recipricol to get:

5 * 2 = 5 / (1/2)

which to skip rules and steps because I don't remember my math, I'll ""prove"" it in a practical way using decimal division:
            ______
= 0.5 |  5.00
        _____
= 5 | 50.0   (yup, I don't even remember what that is called, but I recall, if dividing by a decimal, multiply it by 10 until you get a whole...errr... NATURAL?  number.  And with division, whatever you do on the left, you must do on the right if you want the divider line thingy/""see-saw"" balanced properly.

= 10

OK - that was NOT shorter than the reduction method. The real short was I was going for before I remembered I was in a Math class and I further remembered my fiesty 9th Grade teacher's glares directed at me when I'd wave my hand and say things like ""'cos that's how it works"" because I could never recall rules easily...

My ""waving hands method"": 
-Whenever you want to knock out a fraction in the numerator/dividend - just multiply with something that reduces down to 1 (i.e. a/a)  where ""a"" is equal to the denominator of the fraction you want ""gone"" from the numerator/denominator.
----------------------------------


Back to the example:
 = (1/(7/8)^4)  i.e. 1 over (7/8) to the *positive* 4th power.

Using the (not sure of name, but pretty sure from empirical testing/inference) distribution property of division, the Ying to multiplication's Yang, we get 1 over 7^4 / 8^4 

To get rid of the denominator's fraction we multiply the existing fraction by 8^4 / 8^4 (ie: ""1""), giving us:

8^4/7^4 or (8/7)^4

UGH! Now I realized how:  a^-n = 1 / a^n   is not ""put a 1 over the negative-exponent-term and make the negative exponent positive.""

It is: ""invert the negative exponent term"" and the inverse of 7/8 *IS* 1 / (7/8) but that is REALLY the same as (8/7) in one hand-waving ""inverse"" flippy thing rule!  The whole ""1 over thing"" is because the examples APPEARED to use a ""Natural"" number because ""a"" was the term vs ""a/b"" but ""a"" COULD stand for a fraction, errr Rational/Irrational number.

Facepalm. Didn't notice that until I was typing how to use the calculator to validate your reduction.


You can verify this on a Windows calculator by typing:
Original problem: (7/8)<x^y key>4<+- key>
My proposed solution: (8/7)^4

Both should give the same result.

I would encourage you to stick with the course and struggle with the syntax until you get used to it.  I come from a software development background so the syntax seems pretty natural to me, but I can understand how it would be confusing if you were new to it.  Just be sure to use parantheses () around expressions if you are unsure about the precedence of the different operator symbols (eg. *, /, ^).  The other thing is to put * in between things you are multiplying, eg. 4ab is 4*a*b.  Have you read the ""How to enter math expressions"" document linked in the course navigation?

Also make use of the 'preview' button because it lets you see how your syntax has been interpreted!

I'm sure after doing a few weeks of quizzes you will be a lot more confident and capable with it, and then it will be yet another thing you have learned from the course :)

Good luck

By Honor Code, I am not allowed to help, but since week 1 does not count as our grade, perhaps I could help?

A useful way to do solve this is by: Prime Factorization. Which breaks the number down to its most basic number.

72 =  3*3*2*2*2 

98 = 7* 7 * 2

Look at these, Notice how they both have the number 2.

The question includes 3 * sqrt(98), so we must times the 7 by 3: 21*sqrt(2)

If you still need help rationalizing the denominator, here are my steps:
multiply the problem by a fraction made of the denominator amount in the numerator position over the same denominator (value of 1, right?) The trick is, where there is a negative number, write a plus sign instead, both above and below. 
Then CAREFULLY multiply the two, using FOIL.
Simplify.
All the numbers in the denominator are now rational.
Since you have a negative exponent in the outside of the brackets, flip the whole problem, square the constants, MULTIPLY the exponents by 2. 
Looking at your work, you have the answer divided by 3 - incorrect. Also, the way you need to imput this, you need to divid the 13 separately, dividing it by itself. (I then entered it as a decimal) and when entering square root, parse it sqrt(number).

I realize this difference may be trivial to the math aces, but I'm not one, and I am just stumped what to do now that I have a fraction on my hands. I have come across other quizzes that I couldn't answer based on what I did in ALEKS and were only covered in a very simplified form in the lectures.

I'm not sure what to do - my best guess is -262,144/387,420,489, which is, well, wrong. Or I could see if someone gave away the answer in a forum and just copy it. Or not worry about the week 1 quizzes since they don't count anyways.

I understand this may be seen as ""nitpicky"" and I certainly bow to the authority of the coursework designers/professors in deciding these - but I'll offer this feedback with my reasoning.

I would greatly appreciate it if any weekly duedates, if set for the ""end of the week"" vs any ""one day"" or ""x day"" assignments given midweek (should anything like that happen later on) be set to be handed in ""prior to the start of the work day of the next week.""

In other words, making things due by 5am Monday (PST, I guess ...) or 3AM PST (...I guess) on Monday (I, of course consider this Midnight Sunday since I am in NY and also because I tend to think of ""night"" as anytime between nightfall and the first of: ""I go to sleep"" or ""sunrise."" Usually it is the former, but on some days due to production deadlines, I might work straight through the night until the next day either at home or even in my office without going home.

I get very little time during the week for study/assignments even when the office is sane. When I do anything for myself, it is after I rush to get home in time to read my son his nightly chapter(s) from whatever book we are reading. After that, I tend to eat and do a short list of must-dos. By 9:30-10PM, I usually watch a one hour show of whatever series we are watching presently and then after any chatting and only then, can I go into the den for ""unstructured"" time (and that's ignoring normal housework/bookkeeping which I usually postpone until Sat if I can.)

I live in NY, so today for example, being Saturday - I took care of my 5yo son most of the day. Due to work, I missed nightimes with him 2x this week and I usually only have time to kiss him goodbye in the mornings. I just finished making his and wife's dinner because she is sick. I looked and thought - OK about 6 more hours to do the remaining 5 lectures and 6 quizzes since I can't hand them in on Sunday...

Then remembered it was 11PM PST not EST (last online class was a NY College.)

Yes, I know I am not matriculated or being truly graded etc. ""Late deductions"" even if they apply are therefore essentially meaningless if I learned the material during the lessons. Getting the answers right through understanding the concepts is more important than the grade I am give for those right answers to me.

But... while I am 48 years old, I can ""act like a teenager"" (no insult intended to present company - for teenagers, the behavior I engage in often is fine and an expected stage in life. Not so much for someone at my age) perhaps it is the ADD diagnosed at 45, or perhaps it is some other neurosis or character flaw, but at this point I know what I am and what my track record is. If I treat deadlines as real and the course as real (it IS real, I mean if I treat it as having external consequences, where I can fail to meet my end of the bargain - vs only letting myself down) then I will most likely learn successfully and complete assignments on time (even if rushed on the weekends.)  

I've had Math texts, a Math HS-College app on PC and Macbook and even Algebra/Precalc/CalculusI for Dummies for nearly 2 years since my last class at Westchester and I haven't gotten past the first chapters of any of it. Always life has other things competing for my attention and on weekends I end up blowing most of anything else just to be with my boy. If I don't have deadlines I can meet fairly, I will let it slide and once sliding...inertia and habit may turn me back into the intelligent underperforming 2.0 - 2.2 GPA Dan of 18-19 instead of the 4.0 GPA hardworking (sometimes only one completing on time for the in-class classes actually) student in my 44-46 years.

Before I would have argued that most taking this are ""working folks"" and/or ""stay-at-home-caretakers"" who can't get to schools, but that was because all my other online classes were billed at the same rates as in-person classes. Now that it is ""free"", may people take it who are students already attending classes and even kids who are wise beyond their years using this to supplement gradeschool-HS work or even trying to learn it ahead of time (I wonder if every adult at some point in their lives thinks that ""wow this is a great time to be young"" with all the new technology coming out and tools for ppl to use.... ;) )

So... if can - move the times so that the whole weeknd falls in the allowed hand-in time. I have lived my life sacrificing sleep for time to do things, so I am OK with being up until 3-4AM to get work done because I can't start earlier like some, but I can't pull time out of my donkey.

I am also aware that my situation is purely of my own making. I am the one who by default ""dropped out"" of College after 2.5 years...always meaning to return. Since then, I've had two careers and at this point as a Senior C++ Engineer at my salary grade I cannot do any better with a BS or even MS. I expect it would take a PhD to affect my ""desirability"" to employers, given my experience.

I was told, after I was hired at Goldman Sachs by my boss that reading my extensive resume the HR folks must have not done the Math on the dates I listed for schooling on Page 3: Hofstra Sept 83-Jan 86 - especially since I listed a major not a degree. No other developer there was self-taught without a College degree.

So ya, I am doing this only for myself. To be even more honest, I have left Calculus to the end of my requirements (5 classes to go, 2 are Calculus 2 are Physics which use Calculus - I picked it because I love that science and Astronomy the most, Chemistry was a second but... if I need to learn Calc, then Physics and be damned! :) ) I left Calc to the end because I have no real reason to expect that I will get it ""this time"" when I had trouble in HS Calc II and all my many tries of II and I in College. No real reason other than my inward drive, no car troubles (it was 35 mile drive each way),  no girlfriend distractions ;P and after a couple years of in-person/online classes - the proof that I can take it seriously and work hard and even help others in classes where I was at least as proficient as the instructors.

I'm not as wound up as this stream-of-consciousness ramble may imply, I have behavioral reasons for my rambles and I've come to terms with it - up to others to skim or skip what I right, I write what I feel that's all I can do. I just want to beat Calculus for once so I can then actually continue my studies into an MS/PhD or however far I get before I die or become unable to remember things ;P  It doesn't matter when, I don't >expect< to finish. Been doing a 2year degree for 2 years of 1-2 classes a semester + prior credits and with lapses in between now making it 4 years later. I expect if I become pre-calc proficient so can feel hopeful can take Calc I for credit ONLINE instead of in person (prob won't take in persons until my son is >11/12 and cares less if I am around :( ) then I can actually maybe make up for the mistakes of my youth. OK, one of them...the others, oh well... we move on :)

******A very long ramble-some note, absolutely no need to even read or comment unless you feel obliged. :-)******

I have finished week 1 and not that this necessarily matters to anyone but myself, but this is a HUGE accomplishment for me! I am terrible with math, especially algebra. If I cannot do basic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on a calculator, then count me OUT! 

I struggled all through high school in every math course and had to work my butt off to get a B-, an it was just barely. Math does not come easily to me. I look like a deer in headlights. No joke. I'm great with English Literature and History, but not math nor science. ICK!

I went on to take logic, an equivalent for the math credit at University of Phoenix but ended up dropping the course. Logic was NOT logical to me in any sense of the matter. My instructor said day one, ""You'll either get it and love it, or you won't, and you'll hate it."" Yep, I didn't, and I hated it. Then I decided to take online courses instead and enrolled in an algebra course. Could not for the life of me figure out how to enter algebraic equations on the internet (mind you, this was about 10 years ago so some of the ""bots"" were not available then), literally had panic attacks because I wasn't getting it and fell so far behind, so I dropped it too. 

I then learned I could study on my own and take the CLEP exam to test out of math. What a relief! I studied for a couple of months, went to take the test and I froze. (Did I mention I have test anxiety?) I struggled through that the best that I could, ran out of time and missed passing the exam by 1 question. What a horrible feeling! 

I am just one course credit away from getting my Associates Degree and math has been a monster of a hurdle for me! It's been four years since my epic CLEP exam fail and I'm ready to get this done so I can move on to bigger and better things! Hence the reason for my enrollment into this free course; to prepare me to take and PASS the CLEP exam and ultimately get my A.A.S.!!! 

SO, after a VERY long story and a bit of my history, I can say with a HUGE sigh of relief.... I have conquered week 1 with just a few bumps, and actually feel pretty good about my understanding of our first week!!!! One down, 9 more to go :-) YAY ME!

Everyone enjoy the rest of their weekend! 
GO RAVENS!

Principle 1:
Powers represent multiplies of a number so 2^2 = 2*2 = 4  and 2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8.

Principle 2:
When you multiple two negatives together you get a positive so for example  (-2)*(-4) = 8  while (-2)*(4) = -8



Putting the 2 Principles together:

So when you have a negative number to a power the even powers will end up giving you a positive number.
(-2)^2 = (-2)*(-2) = 4
(-2)^3 = (-2)*(-2)*(-2) = (4)*(-2) = -8

This is how negative numbers behave when you have an integer exponent.

Principle 3:
But when you have an even root that is a different story.
(-2)^(1/2) = Sqrt(-2) = sqrt(-1*2) = sqrt(-1)*sqrt(2).  The sqrt(-1) is not a real number [recall the first lecture video on the definition of a real number].  For where we are in the course view it as undefined but you'll learn more about what it is later.  
Because it is ""undefined"" can't perform the operation described in the video.  That's why the rule is stated that the base number must be positive when n is even.  This will make more sense when we get to complex numbers I believe in week 4.",2236,357,1359858575

3. Watch example for rule #2 (~1:30 mins in). It seems to me that the 2nd example where index is 3 and power of the radicand is 12 can be excluded by the first rule as well as the second. If I was setting up the example, for clarity I'd maybe reverse those and show a 12th-root of x to the 9th power. I am a dev so I hate non-determinism ;) If the expression was the input to a function, if the rules were applied in the order shown, example#2 would trigger the #1 rule engine/logic.

...........................................................



I haven't had time to read up on the ethics rules. I have taken all my tests and checked the box because I wasn't reading my notes, googling, using a calculator (although I need to look it up, 'cos a calc may be helpful to me when I reverse engineer rules I've forgotten over the years.) So I am not sure what I can say. 

Thankfully, my memory is god-awful (or maybe not QUITE ""thankfully"") and I have no clue what the question was on the test.
I assume going over the one given in my notes won't be that great a help, so I will try to make one up.

Again, I am taking this b/c haven't had ANY math in like 27 years and I never passed Calc I (past HS Calc I) and never finished college to boot - but since no one has responded:


The key to rationalizing the denominator to simplified form is to use a known process that sets you up to being able to knock out the radicals simply by multiplying the fractional expression by 1 (one) !

The specific ""flavor"" of ""one"" is the trick. Using the identity rule (going from memory, check the properties of integers video for the correct name and rule) you know you can always multiply any number by 1 and you end up getting the same number. (Works for division and for Add/Sub you use 0, ie: you can add 0 or subtract 0 and still get the same number.)

That Truth seems ""Self-evident"" does it not? Well, there is more than one way to say ""1"". For example: fractionally: 2/2, 5/5, 177/177, ...  So if you had a fraction like:

1 / (2/77) and you wanted to remove the fraction in the denominator, you could multiply it with this brand of ""1"": 77/77.

1/ (2/77) * 77/77 = (1 * 77) / ((2 * 77)/77)

Again using rules I can't recall - probably basic elementary school teachings, you can split up ((2 * 77) / 77) into ((2 / 1) * (77/77)). Which means the 77's go away in the numerator and you are left with 2 /1 which is simply ""2"". You could have tested this by multiplying 2*77 then dividing by 77 (on a calc, I suggest) to check the validity. Basically, you pick the numbers for your ""1"" so that it matches the denom you want to exterminate.

So, back to the simplifying rationals. The trick value that we need to multiply against the denominator is called ""the conjugate"" of the denominator. 

For example:   
(5 * sqrt(7) - sqrt(33) ) / ( 3 * sqrt(7) - 11 * sqrt(33))

The conjugate is whatever the expression is in the denominator but with the ""-"" combining the terms changed to a ""+"".
Since we do not want to change the expression we are simplifying, we use that ""1"" representation trick (which is why I described it above) and multiply by:
( (3 * sqrt(7)) + (11 * sqrt(33))) / ( (3 * sqrt(7)) + (11 * sqrt(33)))   which is the same as saying ""1"" if you look at it.

Now, the next step is using F.O.I.L. which is explained, I thin in the prior video. (I don't recall b/c I think I paused it to work along and tool ""foiling"" to be some rule/property I forgot and stumbled onto FOIL via googling ""foiling""):
It is an acronym, not a process. It means to multiply the terms in this order: [F]irst terms + [O]uter terms + [I]nner terms + [L]ast terms.  

Remember that if one of the terms is negative, you end up with a negative number and it becomes (term1 * term4) + (term1 * -term3) ... which becomes:  (term1 * term4) + -(term1 * term3) ... which is: (term1 * term4) - (term1 * term3) ...

So, for my random example:
8
((5 * sqrt(7)) - sqrt(33) ) / ((3 * sqrt(7)) - (11 * sqrt(33)))
For the numerator:
= ((5 * sqrt(7)) - sqrt(33) ) * ( (3 * sqrt(7)) + (11 * sqrt(33))) )  / (((3 sqrt(7)) - (11 * sqrt(33))) * ( (3 * sqrt(7)) + (11 * sqrt(33))))
= ((5 * sqrt(7)) * (3 * sqrt(7))) + ((5 * sqrt(7)) * (11 * sqrt(33))) - (sqrt(33) * (3 * sqrt(7)) ) - (sqrt(33) * (11 sqrt(33)) ) 
= (15 * sqrt(7^2)) + (55 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(33)) - (3 * sqrt(33) * sqrt(7)) - (11 * sqrt(33^2))
= (15 * 7) + (55 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(33)) - (3 * sqrt(33) * sqrt(7)) - (11 * 33))
 = (105 + (55 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(33)) - (3 * sqrt(33) * sqrt(7)) - 363)
 = (-258 + (55 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(33)) - (3 * sqrt(33) * sqrt(7)) )
 = -258 + (55 * sqrt(231)) - (3 * sqrt(231)) )
 = -258 + (52 * sqrt(231))
(ugh, I'm sorry)

Denominator:
((3 * sqrt(7)) - (11 * sqrt(33))) * ( (3 * sqrt(7)) + (11 * sqrt(33))) 
= ((3 * sqrt(7)) *  (3 * sqrt(7))) + ((3 * sqrt(7)) *  (11 * sqrt(33))) - ((11 * sqrt(33)) * (3 * sqrt(7))) - ((11 * sqrt(33)) * (11 * sqrt(33))) 
rearranging things (since I tried to use ""Render Math"" button to check this and nothing came out, either I don't understand or I miswrote them all... its nearly 1AM, so can't even imagine how to fix it. If worst comes, maybe can do it on some whiteboard thing I read about here) you get (denominator):
= ((3 * sqrt(7)) *  (3 * sqrt(7))) + ((3 * sqrt(7)) *  (11 * sqrt(33))) - ((3 * sqrt(7)) * (11 * sqrt(33))) - ((11 * sqrt(33)) * (11 * sqrt(33))) 
Note that the 2 middle terms negate each other (always do if you did it right):
= ((3 * sqrt(7)) *  (3 * sqrt(7)))  - ((11 * sqrt(33)) * (11 * sqrt(33))) 
= ((9 * sqrt(7^2))) - (121 * sqrt(33^2)) 
= (9 * 7) - (121 * 33) 
= 54 - 3993 
= -3939

so... (sorry about number sizes, I picked nums w/o thinking and by this point wasn't going to reedit it all especially since no idea if I blew any of the parens already. Hopefully the word parts plus references to videos will be enough even if my example is written wrong? :(

it is:
(-258 + (52 * sqrt(231))) / -3939

That was terrible. I now realize I need to ""pick"" good numbers to end up with a clean answer like we get in examples and quizzes. 

Again, hopefully the descriptions help since the numbers are ugly and the thing didn't even format when used the same formats I use in quizzes.

2273816,"Hi everyone!

I've been reading the forums for the past few days, and I have noticed that A LOT of you are having trouble with correctly entering answers for quizzes.

Basically, all the info you need is provided here: **[""How to enter math expressions""][1]**, but here is a list of some of the most commons things you are having difficulty with.

*1. Exponents, powers*

 - Positive exponents: **x^46** = x to the forty-sixth power
 - Positive exponents: **(x^46)+(y^56)** = x to the forty-sixth power + y to the fifty-sixth
 - Multiple variables under an exponent: **(x+y)^14** = (x + y) to the fourteenth power
 - Negative exponents: **x^-7** = x to the negative seventh power
 - EQUIVALENT NOTATION: **1/(x^7)** = 1/x to the seventh power

*2. Roots*

 - Square root of number x: **sqrt(x)**
 - Square root of multiple variables: **sqrt(x+y)**
For ALL other roots, you can use any of the following notations:
 - Cube root of any number (I'll use... 47, for example): **root(47,3)** 
 - Fourth root of, lets say, 17: **root(17,4)**
 - Sixteenth root of 1000: **root(1000,16)**

And so on. The point is, you need to write **root(of which number,which root)**

*3. Fractions*

 - Numerator (a) over denominator (b): **a/b**
 - Multiple variables in numerator (for example, a+c and all that to the fifth power, over b): **((a+c)^5)/b**
 - Multiple variables in denominator (for example, a over d*x and x to the third power): **a/(d*x^3)**

And you can do any kind of combinations with the notations listed above, just make sure you:

 1. Separate things that go together by parentheses
 2. NEVER forget to write the multiplication sign, especially for variables, such as 3x = **3*x**, 5xy^2 = **5 *x*y^2**
 3. ALWAYS use preview (if given the option) to check if you entered everything correctly
 4. DO NOT substitute multiplication by parentheses. (a+b)(c+d) WILL NOT WORK. You have to add the multiplication (or division) sign: **(a+b)*(c+d)**
 5. Do not add spaces between variables, symbols, parentheses. (Unless the question specifies separating integers by spaces)


Also, if you get ""Error parsing ..."" error, you most likely forgot to add a symbol somewhere (for example, you wrote 5x instead of **5*x**) or you are raising ""nothing"" to a power (for example, ^3*x*y - the **^3** doesn't represent anything, if it's not appointed to some number).

If anyone has any other questions on **how** to enter a certain expression, you can all write them here, and someone will definitely help you with difficulties. I just thought it better to have all such info in one topic, rather than throughout the forum.

Good luck!

Ines



**Note:** All **""+""** signs written above can be replaced by **-** for subtraction, ***** for multiplication and **/** for division. I just used + to give one operation example for each notation.

In the syllabus it mentions that you should work primarily within ALEKS as all the videos are embedded and it intelligently works to your strengths and weaknesses. That all seems great however you still have to do the weekly quizzes through coursera in order for it to count towards your final mark. 

So the problem is that ALEKS seems to cover things in a different order and doesn't seem to parallel the weekly subjects exactly so I am not sure when I am ready for the quizzes. Add to that that you get a penalty to your score if you don't finish the quizzes within the week and I am left having to watch all the videos on the site and attempt the quizzes having not worked through it in ALEKS.

Here we are starting the second half of the course.  The number of threads dealing with syntax seems to have decreased significantly, so  I shall not  add anything new this week unless I see a common syntax problem in this week's threads.






**Saturday Feb 23 - Week 5**


Lessons, assignments and quizzes have been released early this week.  Looks like there should be a minimum number of syntax errors.  Just two notes:

1.  Ordered pairs such as (5,7) are entered with the brackets included.

2.  Just the right hand side of the equation of a line such as y=3x-5 is entered in the answer box.  Remember to enter 3x-5 as 3*x-5.

**Monday Feb 18 - Syntax for Week 4**

Just a few comments this week.

Kudos to the profs for trying their best to give us questions whose answers often reduce very nicely so that inputting them is simplified.

General comments:

1.  I see in threads that some people are still entering two answers to a problem and getting the answer marked wrong because one of the answers is not valid.

2.  Numbers of the form $$a+bi$$ are inputted as $$a$$ $$ b$$ with a space between the $$a$$ and $$b$$.

**3.  Quiz 4 - Question 1 contradicts comment #2.  If I arrived at the answer 28i  which is 0 + 28i for this question, I would expect to input 0 28.  Doesn't work.  Nor does inputting just 28 work.  For this question you would input 28i and it would work!!**   

4.  Quiz 2 - Question 2 - Only the smallest answer is wanted.  I know that contradicts the instructions at the bottom of the answer box, but one answer (the smallest solution) is wanted and only one answer will work.

5.  Comment #4 applies to Quiz 3 - Question 1 as well.


**Sunday Feb 10 - Syntax for Week 3**

Happy times are here during week 3 for those who have had problems with syntax.

Week 3 - Quiz 1 - Four questions. Four numerical answers to be inputted. Week 3 - Quiz 2 - Three questions. One number to be entered and two multiple choice questions. Week 3 - Quiz 3 - One numerical answer and two multiple choice questions.

1.  The answers to two questions involve inputting coefficients only, so if the coefficients are 2, 10 and -4, just input 2 10 -4.  One space between numbers is all that is needed.

2.  The other two questions involve factoring.  An expression of the form (2x-5)(5x+2) must be inputted as (2*x-5)*(5*x-2). 

Now that seems simple enough.  But it did take me 4 attempts -- no problems figuring out the answers but formatting answers for this system takes getting used to.

Coming from the colder weather of Canada, I am enjoying some beautiful weather in Florida for two weeks so I am not posting as often.

There seems to be fewer posts concerning syntax now.  Hopefully this means people are adapting to the syntax rules.

I did work out the rest of the quizzes.  Here are some typical syntax structures in the answers:

1.  $$\frac {5(x+4)} {(x-7)} $$ is entered at (5*(x+4))/(x-7)

2.  $$ \frac {(b-2)} {5(b+4)} $$ is entered as (b-2)/(5*(b+4))

Other than that, Quiz 2 #3 is on of those questions that you give yourself a pat on the back when you get the question correct.

Kudos to the profs for giving us a complicated looking expression which simplifies so nicely to a much simpler expression.  Am tempted to say more, but no spoilers here!!  Half the fun of doing a problem is spending time working out a solution and then looking at it and saying ""wow"" -- that was a little work of art!!

Back to the sun for most of the rest of this week.  Will look to help with syntax errors when I can.",2464,414,1359949757

There is no way to contact the ALEKS ALMIGHTY to tell them that they didn't program their system perfectly (something that has NEVER been accomplished since the beginning of time). I was asked to provide the complex roots to a quadratic equation when the determinant was not less than zero, meaning that the roots were real, which are also complex, so valid as an answer. However, I input the roots in complex number standard form, using 0i to signify that I understood that these were real roots, but also were complex, and the system threw me back three paces, explaining things to me as if I was in kindergarten, and now I have to prove I understand things by answering the same kinds of questions correctly three more times as penance.

And for part 3:  Let $$x$$ denote the westbound trains travel rate, and then the eastbound train travels at a rate of $$x -16$$, then from the video we know that the distance between the trains is given by the equation $$d = rt$$ where $$r, t$$ are the rate of travel and time respectively.

Let's tackle your problems one at a time.

**2x^2+7x+5**

First, let's find two numbers such as they sum up to 7, and at the same time their product is 10. Trying out different combinations, I picked 2 and 5. OK, now rewrite the expression as

2x^2+2x+5x+10.

Now group first pair and second pair:

2x(x+1)+5(x+1)

(x+1) is a common factor, so we and up with

(x+1)(2x+5)  That's it!

Continue at next post, stay tuned...",2803,490,1360147438
2426010,"Second beast:
**2x^2+9x+10**

As in the previous problem, we have to pick two mistery numbers. Feel free to draw a table and write down all the possible combinations. I stopped with 4 and 5. So:

2x^2+5x+4x+10

OK, now groupping first pair and second pair:

x(2x+5)+2(2x+5)

(2x+5) is a common factor, so:

**(2x+5)(x+2)** is your answer

Stay tuned...",2804,490,1360147770
2426010,"**27y^3+X^9**

Take a closer look at the numbers: 27 is 3^3, x^9 is (x^3)^3. Right? So you are dealing with perfect cubes!
Apply formula for perfect cube:

(3y+x^3)(9y^2-3yx^3+x^6)

Now you can play with numbers in the the second parenthese to make them look even nicer.
Good luck!

Now, if you happen to have something like $$2x^2+7x+5$$ you have to understand where your $$2x^2$$ comes from. 

Because $$2x*x=2x^2$$, then your factored form should look like $$(2x+n)(x+m)$$. And once we foil that ""general"" formula we get $$ 2x*x+2x*m+x*n+n*m=2x^2+2xm+xn+nm$$= $$2x^2+x(2m+n)+nm $$

Therefore, when you're looking for the value of $$n$$ and $$m$$ in $$2x^2+7x+5$$, you must find numbers that verify $$nm = 5$$ and $$2m+n=7$$ . The easiest way to do that is to use the method used by Dmitriy Startsev.",2807,490,1360150702

 - Make sure you group the expression in () where necessary (for example a denominator)
 - You need to use a * between two expressions in ()  (...) and (...)
 - You need a * between a coefficient and x and between x and other variables
 - Use SQRT(...) for a square root as a short cut and ^(1/n) for any other root
 - Read the question carefully. For example if it states enter A B C (coefficients) separated by spaces it doesn't want the expression.",2835,496,1360165622

Questions for the Coursera staff :

What happened to the Preview button we had for the Week 1 quizzes?  That was extremely useful for making sure we were writing answers in a way the software could interpret.

Also -- is there way to just redo the questions you got wrong in a quiz?  It seems like you have to re-take the entire quiz.   ",2845,495,1360168306

If 6*x+15 is your numerator, and (x+1)*(2*x+5)*(x+2) is denominator, the expression on parser's slang is:

(6*x+5)/((x+1)*(2*x+5)*(9*x+2))

Mind the extra parenthese around the numerator and denominator.

Good luck.

478662,"Anything you need to multiply together needs to be done with an asterisk.  Write it this way: 19-7*sqrt(14).  This is literally the number 19 minus the number of 7 multiplied by the the square root of 14.   This should answer your question.

For a little more information consider the following:
Remember that a square root of a number is that number raised to the 1/2 power. 

So to write your expression by raising a power:  19 - 7 *( 14^(1/2) ) 
This literally says the number 19 minus the 7 multiplied by the number of 14 raised to the 1/2 power.  I added parenthesis around some of the expressions to ensure that they are evaluated in the order I want them to be.  So I put parenthesis around (1/2) for the exponent so that I don't accidentally divide everything by 2.  I also added parenthesis around (14 ^ (1/2)) so I make sure that only 14 is raised to the 1/2 power.  Whatever is inside the parenthesis will be evaluated together.

With all this mind I can change your square root to cube root without needing something like ""curt()"" for cube root instead of ""sqrt()"" for square root.  Here's the new expression using cube root of 14:  19 - 7*(14^(1/3))

I hope this all makes sense.",2849,496,1360169645
2209786,"In reply to David Flynn, I do not think the problem is expecting to succeed first time. I certainly do not.  However I also did not expect to be spending at least half my time on this site trying to make my quiz answers acceptable. I want to be able to enter the answer and be told it is right or wrong.  I can then continue or try again as is appropriate.  Instead I am fighting with Preview (when it is there) trying to find ways to make it reproduce the terms I am entering.  I keep failing - and it is not because I have not been reading all the various instructions available (*I am getting better but is a slow process*).  It is clear from my reading of these forums that a very large number of us are having similar difficulties. It is a huge distraction and a disincentive to continuing with the course.  


Personally  I am exceedingly grateful that this course exists - and is free.   I am in the UK and to do the same course here would cost up to £2000 (about $3100) and, whilst I am prepared to pay something,  I am just not that rich.   I am grateful too for all the hard work that has clearly gone into the course.  Having said that I do believe insufficient attention has been paid to the matter of answering the quizzes. It needs to be easier to enter the answers.  It is clear that Anonymous will not be alone in pulling out because of this problem and I, for one, can understand why.  


For myself I intend to persevere but it is already clear to me that I am not going to be able to complete the quizzes within the specified time-frames.  I could not do so in the first week, despite my best endeavours, and this week is, as is to be expected, proving harder.

I can understand a bit of frustration if it doesn't work the way people think it does, and perhaps this will be sorted out for next time if there are enough complaints (such as an extra optional lecture).

I agree with your thesis that one should not give up at the first sign of trouble but the fact is that the trouble is coming from an unexpected source and it does act as a disincentive.  I have tried very hard to get this right and am still getting it wrong.

I am enjoying this course and am glad I am taking the challenge, which it is, tremendously, for me.

I spent a lot of time (frustrated) with getting the symbols and multiplication, etc.  in the right place.  When I finally got my ALEKS subscription working (needed JAVA updated and a few other things for my Mac before I could use it) it became much easier to enter my answers in the ALEKS website than it is the coursera website.

My brain is able to keep these properties and functions, etc. organized and grouped so cleverly by the Coursera course and the use of ALEKS.  I will be able to know exactly what the terminology is and where it is useful instead having to constantly refresh my memory bank of functions, etc.  I am over 40 and truly wish these were available during my school years.

Another problem may come from the hierarchical evaluation of math operations and misplaced parentheses. At the very basic level, math ops are processed left-to right as long as they are all on the same level. But, exponents and roots are higher than multiplication and division which in turn are higher than addition and subtraction. For example; 2+3-2 = 5-2 = 3 is processed **Left-to-Right** because these operations are on the same level while **2+2*2^2 = 2+2*4 = 2+8 = 10** is processed **Right-to-Left** because each operation is on a different level and highest-to-lowest forces the evaluation to go R-to-L. Now adding some parentheses can force the evaluation **Left-to-Right** so that **(((2+2)*2)^2) = ((4*2)^2) = (8^2) = 64**. And then if I forget one of my parentheses I get a different answer all together: **(((2+2*2)^2) = ((2+4)^2) = (6^2) = 36**. Now this last example will probably generate a parsing error but these type of errors can be difficult to find. So your parentheses need to be paired, if you have 3 open parens you need to have 3 close parens, and they need to be properly matched, the first goes with the last, the second goes with the next to last and the third goes with the third from the last.",2982,55,1360255729

1954965,"I'll answer here but i think there's already a thread for this problem. 

We're asked to perform indicated operations and simplify $$4(x-2)^2-3(x-2)+1-(4x^2-3x+1)$$ to the form $$Ax^2+Bx+C$$. 
The main difficulties here are the order of operations and sign changing. To make it easier to read, i'll just cut the expression into 3 pieces: 

**First bit**: $$4(x-2)^2$$. We know that $$(n-m)^2=n^2+m^2-2nm$$. 
So we get $$4\times (x^2+4-2\times 2\times x)$$

$$=4\times (x^2+4-4x)$$

$$=(4\times x^2)+(4\times 4)+(4 \times (-4x))$$

$$=4x^2+16-16x$$

**Next bit**: $$-3(x-2)+1$$

$$=(-3\times x)+(-3\times -2)+1$$

$$=-3x+6+1$$

$$=-3x+7$$

**Last one**: $$-(4x^2-3x+1)$$ Here we have to be careful of that minus sign in front of the parenthesis. One way to make no mistake that i was taught when learning algebra was to replace it with $$-1$$ and then foil the expression step by step
$$=-1(4x^2-3x+1)$$

$$=(4x^2\times (-1))-3x\times (-1)+(1\times (-1))$$

$$=-4x^2+3x-1$$    

Now you put all the pieces back together, regroup the like terms ($$x^2$$ with $$x^2$$, $$x$$ with $$x$$, etc.), add or substract when possible and you should end up with the good answer. 

In this case, there's a little ""trap"" as the answer you'll get will be of the form $$Bx + C$$, and we're asked for a list of values for A, B and C. Well, if $$Ax^2 = 0$$ we can assume that $$A=0$$. Therefore, when typing in your answer you should input 0 B C",3079,490,1360315280

1954965,"I'll pick other values, so that i don't give the answer to the quizz, let's say: $$y=\frac{(7x-3)}{(5x+2)}$$

First, we multiply both sides by $$(5x+2)$$ to get rid of the fraction:

$$y\times(5x+2)=\frac{(7x-3)}{(5x+2)}\times(5x+2)$$

$$y(5x+2)=(7x-3)$$

$$5xy+2y=7x-3$$

From here, we want every x on one side, every y on the other, to end up with x=y and something. We leave $$5xy$$ on the left for the time being.

$$5xy+2y=7x-3$$

$$5xy-7x=-2y-3$$ 

To get rid of this $$5xy$$ we use $$x$$ as a factor:

$$x\times(5y-7)=-2y-3$$ 

Now we want $$(5y-7)$$ on the right side. To do that we divide both sides by $$(5y-7)$$, which gives us:

$$x(5y-7)\times\frac{1}{(5y-7)}=(-2y-3)\times\frac{1}{(5y-7)}$$

$$x=\frac{(-2y-3)}{(5y-7)}$$

Once you've factored the denominators, you need to find the greatest common denominator.  To do that, all you really need to do is make sure every term in both denominators appear once.

For example (and using fake values) :  

12 / (x+4)(x+3) - 4 / (x+3)(x-5) ===> GCD = (x+3)(x+4)(x-5) ----- note each term is represented ONE time (we don't put x+3 twice even though both terms use it)   

Step 2 : Multiply this GCD by each term of the numerator.  Here's the catch..you don't have to distribute over ALL three terms because two of them will cancel out.  But which 2? (leave that to you to find)  

Step 3 : Your final answer is the combination of like terms in the numerator over the GCD

613722,"I started this course (first week and a half) just using ALEKS. Approaching the end of week two, I found it necessary, occasionally, to view material on Coursera's website.  In my opinion, these are ALEKS's strengths and weaknesses.

Strengths
=========

1. ALEKS evaluates your level of knowledge before trying to teach. It does this by asking you approximately 30 questions on disparate algebraic subjects. This allows for more efficient use of your time since you don't have to waste effort slogging through material you already know. Thus far, it has asked me to perform a re-evaluation once, roughly 7 days into my ALEKS subscription.  I assume it was trying to narrow in on my level of knowledge, again, so that it could teach me in a more efficient manner.

2. As I tackle each new subject, it does a nice job of forcing me to practice a few questions on each subject. Generally, it seems that if I get three answers correct, in a row, it allows me the option of marking that subject as ""learned."" Alternatively, it allows me to keep practicing if I think I need more work.

3. When I miss a question, or when I tell ALEKS that I don't know how to solve the question, ALEKS allows me to click on a button that explains the concept. I have done this a number of times. I have found their explanations to be well formulated, concise, and extremely helpful. Through these brief, written explanations, I have always been able to glean the crux of the problem in, oh... maybe less than a minute or two.

4. Every couple of days, when I first log into ALEKS, the system tells me it is time for review. It presents a couple of topics that I've already marked as mastered, asking me to reattempt a question in that area. I don't think I've missed any review questions yet, so ALEKS has only asked me one question in each area. Since ALEKS is so adaptive, I assume that any errors would result in more questions plus optional explanations.

Weaknesses
==========

1. It is not free. ALEKS seems to offer different subscription lengths.  I purchased an 11-week ALEKS subscription. This Coursera course is 10 weeks long. ALEKS didn't offer a 10-week subscription. I paid $50 US plus tax for this ALEX course, so not only is it ""not free,"" but I think one could argue, it is not even cheap.

2. While ALEKS seems to imply that it will marry-up the material it presents with the actual college-level (and I assume high school or other-level, as appropriate) course, well...it doesn't seem to match up perfectly. To me, this ""promise"" is implied because when I signed up for ALEKS, their system asked me to provide the Coursera course number. Approaching the end of week two, I figured out that ALEKS doesn't follow my specified Coursera course exactly. This became evident when I started doing all the Coursera quizzes from weeks one and two.  At that time, ALEKS was already advertising that I was studying week three material, yet I found I hadn't been exposed (by ALEKS) to a couple (I think two, to be exact) of the Coursera quiz questions.  This was a problem...albeit a minor one.  I simply went to the Coursera website and logged into the forum. A relatively quick search on the forum yielded discussion on each of the questions I didn't know how to solve. Those discussions pointed to video links on the Coursera website explaining those topics.  After viewing those short, Coursera videos, I was able to solve the problems.

3. ALEKS's tool to enter equations is, in my opinion, more advanced that Coursera's. Now I laugh at myself when I realize that I'm evaluating ALEKS as being ""weak"" because it has a tool that is more ADVANCED than Coursera...silly, yeah? The reason I bring it up is because at first, I missed a few Coursera quiz questions when I had to input formulas using a system that is significantly different than the one offered by ALEKS.  As it turns out, this really isn't much of a problem. Yes, you will have to learn two separate ways of entering formulas, but neither is particularly difficult to master. Further, the less advanced system (Coursera's) provides a preview button that allows you, after formula entry, to have Coursera transform your answer into a more readable format, and one closely aligned with ALEKS's format, before actually submitting the answer.

Summary
=======

If your goal is to receive the best grade in this course, then you will be somewhat frustrated by ALEKS's inability to match-up exactly with this Coursera class.  My goal in taking this course is much more about reacquainting myself with algebra from looong ago, and much less about getting a good grade. If that is your goal, then I think ALEKS can go a long way toward teaching what YOU really need to be taught, and will go a long way away from needlessly wasting your time rehashing already mastered concepts. The system, while expensive and while not perfect, is pretty darn good.

2424013,"For me, this problem was about factoring first; and then simplifying, but looking for factors on the top and bottom that might end up cancelling.
1.  Factoring the numerator has 2 steps: first pull a ""3"" out of 12-3*x^2, which leaves you with 3*(4-x^2).  Because (4-x^2) is one of those ""special factor"" cases in the video lecture, I recognized it as one that can be factored further into (2+x)*(2-x).  That left me with 3*(2+x)*(2-x).
2.  Factoring the denominator required looking for factors of -14 that added together would be the coefficient 5.  By trial and error, -7 and 2 fit that role.  Thus, the factored form was (x+2)*(x-7).
3.  Now we have an (x+2) in the numerator and an (x+2) in the denominator. which cancel out.
4.  I wouldn't combine the 3*(2-x) because it leaves you with an unfactored 6-3x.  I would, however, express the (2-x) part with the ""x"" first (that seems to be the preferred order--having the x's first).  So, you have a 3*-(x-2)!

So you canceled (x-2) from the denominator and (2-x) from the numerator, but you can't do this right away.

I have been subscribed to Khan Academy for over a year, and I can't say I know what I am doing.  I need structure and focus, and taking the Coursera course and then using the suggested ALEKS material is EXACTLY what I needed.  I think those who are knocking the ALEKs software are just bitter that a course that is free included a suggestion of another program or supplement that is not free.  It is a suggestion, and it may have come across as being a strong suggestion, but that is BECAUSE ALEK's WORKS!!!  It will make sure you know the material by constantly giving you problems to solve and an explanation.  So, I do understand why some students have gone ahead and mentioned that they will stop Coursera and just use ALEK's.  I don't agree with that method, because I love the videos from Coursera a hundred times more than the videos from ALEKS.  I hope and pray that these professors offer more math classes for free and DEMAND Aleks to be used.  IT WOULD MAKE UP FOR THE $4,000 OF TUITION and fees at a private college that took my money and would not help me find a way to get a current assessment of my skills when I hadn't had math for 7 years.  But, that was 20 years ago, and I am truly appreciative of the Coursera course offered by these professors and there suggestion of using ALEKS.  I will probably go ahead and purchase a year or two year subscription after the course or 11 weeks of usage is over.

I happened to be of an age that when I was in middle school the math curriculum was changed to ""modern mathematics"".  The implementation was a disaster and the result was that a generation of kids left school with compromised ability in mathematics..... I was one of them.

2139599,"Hi Ramesh (I'm Jackie)

I think I understand what you are asking/what your point is.  Are you saying that if Coursera claims to have a learning model largely based on the encouragement and acceptance of self-learning and personal achievement why they then proceed to allow penalties in certain courses?

If this is what you are asking, then I am kind of confused as to why that is happening myself.  I'm a very young recent college grad, and I personally am not seeing a benefit to penalization under a model such as the one Coursera is claiming.  I was never a fan of grades, and I take no notice of them on any of the courses I am taking on the site, however, I am deeply concerned that penalties and other forms of ""punishment"" may seriously deter students who otherwise were ready and willing to work.

I'm not sure what Coursera should do instead, but I feel like if someone *does* want to be graded and/or work towards a certificate that they can obtain as a result of high grades, then that should be an *option*.  I think that for others, who strictly want to/need to learn, they should have a separate option of simply completing work assignments with no grades, penalties, or deadlines and be able to work towards a certificate they can obtain as a result of high completion (if they want to).  I feel that people know how to motivate themselves and can understand the basic mechanics of a class and how it moves forward with new material and will end eventually.  I think they are capable of gathering that were they to move through a course at a slower pace or were ""behind"" that they would not necessarily have as many opportunities to receive help from forums and such.

Again, not trying to offend anyone (or misunderstand you, Ramesh).  I just think that given the sheer number of students and their goals, there should be a decent number of options to choose from that would enable everyone or near-everyone to learn to their satisfaction.",3520,605,1360620694

I have not been having much luck using this course's lectures and whatever else to help me understand problems and work through the quizzes.  I decided to go to khanacademy.org and look at what they had to offer.  

The site is full of lecture videos similar to what's on here, except the content is much more extensive, and the explanations are much more clear (imo).  It's geared towards kids and younger students, but, really, anyone can benefit.  There are quizzes you can use to try out some problems for w/e section you're working on.  And, best part of all, **you can actually see the solution!!** 

Viewing the solution is an option, of course, but it's there, in step-by-step format, if you want to look at it.  There will also be a link to a relevant video if you're stuck and need some help but don't wanna know what the answer is directly.

The site has an entire section dedicated to Algebra with 750 videos total, I think.  You can also become a member and track your progress and win badges and stuff like that.  It's a truly interactive site that has helped me with this class *tremendously.*

     I am just looking for some clarity. I am taking this course to get certification points towards a certificate. I understand that I am not receiving college credit, but the hours in this course will serve my purpose. My question is that I keep seeing a signature track link that says it will give you a certificate of completion for the course. I was under the impression that if we completed all of the work, and if we scored an appropriate grade on the final we would have finished the course. Will I receive a certificate of completion without signing up for the signature track?
Finally, I am not doing the aleks course work. I have simply been doing the videos, course work, and weekly quizzes. I was under the impression that this was all that was required for this course. Am I wrong?

Coolmath.com : A surprisingly underrated site that has a lot of decent practice problems (even though some can be buggy) and explanations for your algebra needs.

Purplemath.com : A site that has a lot of decent stuff on it. I haven't used it nearly as much as the rest.


I find that having MANY resources teaching you the same thing allows you to get multiple points of view and ways of visualizing your math so you can get a more three dimensional way of learning the content instead of simple rote memorization. Also, multiple styles of wording in word problems can help your mind assimilate the logic behind variable naming and solving them so it can more easily be put into practice in every day problems.

Here's a request that's definitely not necessary - just a personal wish list item.

When my kids start peppering me with ""why do I need to know this"", it would be nice to be able to show them concrete examples of higher level math being used to create things. I know there's math equations in things like Google search algorithms or landing software for the Mars Rover, but it seems so esoteric.

Here's another example:

Factor  $$6x^2-13x-5$$

I use decomposition

1.  We are factoring $$ax^2+bc+c$$

2.  Find two numbers whose sum is b and whose product is ac -- in this case two numbers who sum is -13 and whose product is -30.

3.  Work with factors of 30 that with proper signs multiply to give -30:  examples are 10, 3; 6, 5; 15,2

4.  10, 3 looks like they would work, but one sign has to be + and the other -, so we abandon this pair in favour  of -15, 2.

5.  Decompose the middle term $$-13x$$ into  $$-15x + 2x$$

6.  Rewrite the trinomial as $$6x^2-15x+2x-5.$$

7.  Now factor this four term expression by grouping

$$6x^2-15x+2x-5$$

$$=3x(2x-5) -(2x-5)$$          (notice how the 2x-5 factor repeats to become a common factor)

Doing high school algebra is like practising scales on the piano ( or doing football drills for the more athletically minded).  In music the fun begins when you get to play or compose songs or in football when you get to play the game.

The real fun in math I would think starts when you have enough skill sets developed to do Calculus or other higher level math.

Renting the warehouse, paying for lighting, insurance etc.  

Variable Costs: Those costs that vary with the amount of machines manufactured:
Circuit boards, solder, CPUs.  

We're told fixed costs are $ 550,000 (regardless of how many machines we make, could make one, could make 30,000)  
We're told the variable cost for each machine is $120.

So if we made & sold 1 machine our total costs would be $550,000 + (1 * $120) = 550,120  
We sell this one machine at $140 so our profit/loss=140 - 550,120= -$549980

If we made and sold 30,000 machines: Total costs $550,000 + (30,000 * $120) = 4,150,000  
We sell all machines at $140 so our profit/loss: ($140*30,000) - 4,150,000 = $50,000 profit  

So how many machine would you have to  make and sell to break even at zero profit/loss?  

You're effectively being asked to solve 140x - (120x+550000)=0 and then say that the company must make MORE than this amount to make a profit.

The numerator is first factored to 3*(2-x)*(2+x).  The denominator is factored to (x-2)*(x+7), as James correctly corrected me.  At first glance there are no common expressions.  However, remember that you can factor a -1 out of the (2-x) in the numerator, leaving a -1*(-2+x), or -1*(x-2).  So now the numerator is 3*(-1)*(x-2)*(2+x).  If you cross out the common expressions (x-2) in the numerator and denominator, you are left with -3*(2+x) on top, and (x+7) on the bottom.  And I hope I have confused you even more!

738571,"I have absolutely no idea why the lecturers thought it was a good idea to start talking about i without any form of introduction.  Surely they  have realised a large number of the people taking this course have never heard of complex numbers before?

**What is i?**

i is called the imaginary unit and it is defined as i^2 is equal to -1. As the square of any real number is always positive, this means i is not a real number, so we use a symbol for it instead.

**How do we use i?**

i^2 = -1, so we can use i to remove the minus sign from square roots. An example:
sqrt(-9) = sqrt(-1)*sqrt(9) = sqrt(i^2)*sqrt(9) = i*sqrt(9) = i*3 = 3i. How to perform basic arithmatic with i should be explained in the lecture videos

**Why do we use i?**

We can use i to calculate with square roots containing negative values (for example, the square root of -9 as above). This gives so-called ""complex numbers"", which are useful for a number of real world problems. One example is oscillating signal outputs, which occur frequently in process control. Complex numbers can be used to determine how the oscillation will behave.and thus how stable the system is.

Thanks for bringing this 10% quiz penalty issue to my attention. That stuff about the 10% penalty was language that the Courera interface added automatically when we set up the quizzes. I did not realize this was not standardly used in the all the Coursera classes. Myself and Dr. Lehman definitely did not intentionally add this penalty to the late quizzes. The main purpose of the quizzes is to practice the material that you have learned. I think most students will find they are more successful if they keep up with the suggested weekly pace, but I definitely understand the students have busy lives and may fall behind. 

Give me a couple days to investigate and see if this penalty is something I have control over to remove. 

On a related note: We did just change it so the quizzes will have a hard deadline two weeks after they are posted. Several students have asked to have access to the quiz solutions so that they can see what they did wrong eventually. In order to do that, we had to impose a firmer deadline.

Complex numbers are just numbers involving the square root of -1. Last week you learned a lot about polynomials. When finding roots of polynomials you frequently get imaginary answers (i.e. solutions involving the square root of -1). We inserted some information about complex numbers at this point in the course so you can know how to deal with these types of numbers when you encounter them. 

By the way, there are also supplemental readings and assignments every week for the course. These are designed to help connect up the videos into a more cohesive clear story. The videos are just meant to demonstrate and teach small skill pieces. The readings will really help give you a more complete view of how the topics are connected and fit together. I particularly recommend looking at the mathisfun.com page on Complex numbers if these are new to you and you would like to learn more about how they fit with the previous course material.

This week we are studying quadratic equations.

Every quadratic equation has two solutions.

When Descartes started solving quadratic equations in the 1600's, he developed the solution to quadratic equations such as:

$$x^2+7x+12=0$$

By factoring (or using the quadratic formula perhaps)

$$ (x+4)(x+3)=0$$

$$x= -4$$ or $$x= -3$$.

One day he pondered the solution to 

$$x^2+1=0$$

I guess he could have stopped and said ""no solution.""

How can you square a number, add 1 and get 0???!!!??  No real number could be a solution to this problem.

But what if mathematicians who started with natural numbers stopped with those??  Wonder where we would be today??

Luckily they went on to invent (develop?) integers, rationals, irrationals and real numbers.

Descartes did not say there is no solution to $$x^2+1 = 0$$. 

He knew he that no real number satisfied the equation and that he would have to invent ""new"" numbers that would be solutions to the equation.

He said
 
If $$x^2+1=0$$

$$x^2 = -1$$

$$ x = +\sqrt{-1}$$ or $$x = - \sqrt{-1}$$

Deciding to represent $$\sqrt{-1}$$ as $$i$$, he named the first two complex numbers $$i$$ and $$-i$$.

From wikipedia we learn ""when René Descartes coined the term ""imaginary"" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory.""

It seems that Descartes thought these new numbers would be of little consequence in mathematics.  Little did he know that today scientists in many disciplines use these ""imaginary"" numbers to solve many problems.

To start, the first problem tells you to raise the ratio to the power of negative 2. Instead , flip the ratio around so that the top is on the bottom and the bottom is on top and then raise the inverted raiio by the power of 2 (square the new ratio). Then combine like variables by taking the exponent of each variable in the numerator and subtract the exponent of the same variable in the denominator. For example, 3(x^4)*(Y^3)/((x^3)*(y^4)= 3(x^(4-3))*(y^(3-4)=3x*(y^(-1)).

Free is unlikely to last long as somebody has to pay for it.  There's no place for soft deadlines or penalties in self paced learning.

If you take away a box (subtracting), the scale will read ""2"". If you add a balloon to the two boxes (adding a negative), the scale will read ""1"". Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive! If we now remove this balloon (subtracting a negative) the scale will read ""2"" again.

However, it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the complex numbers, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number. This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by i (sometimes j, especially in the context of electricity where ""i"" traditionally represents electric current) and called the imaginary unit, which is defined such that i2 = –1. Using this notation, we can think of i as the square root of –1, but notice that we also have (–i)2 = i2 = –1 and so –i is also a square root of –1. By convention, the principal square root of –1 is i, or more generally, if x is any positive number, then the principal square root of –x is

-4i +6i becomes 2i

so you have 3+2i-8i^2

then using the i rule, i^2 becomes -1

Simplify

2461522,"Hi Teresa,

I think the deadlines are passed, so let me give you an overview of what you want on this problem.  The questions is essentially asking you when will the company break even?  They have a one-time investment (or fixed-cost) and each machine costs money to produce, but also gives some revenue.  One thing to ask yourself: how much profit is the company making per machine sold?  It is $$140 - 120 = 20$$ dollars per macnhine (in general the formula for that will be $$Profit = Revenue - Cost$$).  Now, this is good because the profit is positive.  (What would happen if we came up with a negative profit?  Could the company ever break even?)  

So now we need to figure out what breaking even means.  Let $$x$$ denote the number of machines sold.  Then for each machine sold, we get $$20$$ dollars of profit, or in other words our profit is $$20\cdot x$$.  But, we have a fixed cost of $$550,000$$.  What does this mean?  It pretty much means that the company is ""in a hole"" of $$550,000$$ dollars from the beginning or in other words, if we don't sell any machines we will have lost $$550,000$$ dollars.  Putting all this together, we see that we want:

$$Profit - Fixed Cost > 0$$ or in other words

$$20x - 550,000 > 0$$

Firstly, Your y and z exponents are incorrect.  For instance' with y^5/y^-5.  Remember you are subtracting those exponents,  5-(-5) is 10, not 0 (it's the same as saying 5 + positive 5).  After you get your y and z exponents correct, you then have to apply the -2 power to all the terms.  (Both the numerator and denominator of 6/4 get raised to the -2.)  Once you've done that, you need to apply the negative exponent rule to any negative exponents to make the exponent a positive, which will be its reciprocal, as in x^-10 becomes 1/x^10.  Make sure your fraction is in simplest terms.  When you are entering in the answer, make sure to put parentheses around you number fraction and a * between anything you are multiplying.  No spaces.

The first two weeks I was enrolled in both precalc and Algebra but decided I would stick to Algebra review. At the end of the second week I could not log back into Coursera and it did not recognize my e-mail address any longer. All my quizzes were lost. I wrote e-mails but never received a response. I spent some time last week trying to reenter the quizzes. I still have some difficulty remembering how to enter in my answers correctly and it's taking some time. I am terribly behind at this point and I'm frustrated. It would be great to be able to take advantage of the credit aspect of the course, but realistically, I don't have tons of time to keep trying to reproduce my work, as great as all this review is I'm sure for my education. My college algebra grade was less than stellar and it would be great to improve it, but there are a lot of technical issues that are making this a lot harder than taking a class in person. I mean, I would have had my quizzes on paper and they wouldn't have been lost. Am I the only person who has experienced this problem?

As I understand it, imaginary numbers were invented so that mathematicians could do something with calculations that involved the square root of a negative number. There's no way to square a number and wind up with a negative result, so if someone were doing some sort of calculation and came across a $$\sqrt-2$$, they wouldn't be able to go any further because there's no real number answer. So someone came up with the symbol $$i$$ as a way to keep going. Using the rules of square roots that we've already learned, you could rewrite $$\sqrt-2$$ as $$\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt -1$$, or $$\sqrt2i$$, and then keep working through your calculation.

No i's can be in the denominator.  Once you multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate, the i's will cancel out.

Numerator I'll let you do, but you need to multiply (3-15i)(5-23i)  ===> once you've done that, then you'll have a real part over 554 and an imaginary part over 554.  And that's how you would enter your answer.

I'm trying to catch up on a week that I missed before the new quiz deadlines close, but I'm stuck on Week 2 Quiz 3 Question 4 and I can't determine whether this is a problem with my solution or a problem entering it properly in the quiz app.

I pulled the 3 from the top and determined that I had a perfect square in reverse notation, so I extracted -1 to resolve that. I then factored the denominator and was able cancel out one of the resulting items with its match in the numerator. That left me with -3*remaining numerator/remaining denominator.

Sounds like you're making this a lot harder than you need to.  In simplifying expressions like this, first break out everything you can by factoring.  So your denominator would be (x +/- something)(x+/- something) and your numerator would be -3 (something that could be factored further).  Once you finish factoring, just look for expressions that are common to both the numerator and the denominator and cross them out.  Once both sides have unique factors, simplify where you can.

Mathematics to me, is more of a language and less a set of skills. I'm trying to wire my brain to think mathematically such that I can derive the answer, regardless of whether or not someone has taught me the 'skill' to solve it. A synonym for my definition of skill might be 'technique'. My reason for this approach is that techniques are easily forgotten. Surely anyone can be presented with a technique they've yet to learn... struggle with it... decide it is a weakness... and repeat the technique enough times that they learn the pattern and manage to solve for x. However, given enough time, techniques that show you 'how it works' are easily forgotten since you fall out of practice.

Rationalize the denominator and write in simplified form. 53√−23√−1.

For adding a square root symbol, use sqrt (NUMBER).

Ok so is your question more on how it needs to be inputted to the grader, or did you actually have a question on the method on how to solve?  

I admit the link on the side isn't very helpful at all.  So to get you started, you final answer (whatever it may be), should be of the form :  

(some number + some number * sqrt(some number))/some number  

Notice that if your multiplying a number times a radical, you have to separate the two with the * (you can't just write them together).   Notice also, I'm using parenthesis very liberally to make sure I've got everything together that needs to be.  When you input ANYTHING...you can't have any punctuation at all (no """" or , or .).  For the first quizzes anyway, this will hold true (as you get further along, you may see other symbols being used, but for now, keep your symbols restricted to the arithmatic and the exponential -- i.e. + - * / ^)

Checking them back to the original problem, we see that 5 is acceptable, as √36 = 6; but -6 was not because we are told that √25 does not equal -5. But in the following lecture (Solving an Equation Quadratic in Form) we are told that 9 = x² equals  x = ±√9 equals ±3. Am I missing something here? Wouldn't this also be true: 25 = x² which equals x = ±√25 which equals ±5 — and so than wouldn't -6 be seen as an acceptable answer to example 2, lecture 4.14?

1972059,"x cannot be -6, because $$\sqrt{-6+31}\not=-6+1$$. That was our original equation.

Why is it that $$10\not=-10$$? After all, $$10^2=(-10)^2$$?

The answer lies in the square. When you ""un-square"" an expression, you'll end up with two possible solutions, namely the positive and the negative equal value. But you cannot be sure if both solutions are right. Sometimes they are, sometimes they're not. You have to test them to be sure.

Let's take a look at the equation fresh from the beginning:

$$\sqrt{x+31}=x+1$$. Is it ok to square both sides? Remember $$y=x^2\Leftrightarrow x=\pm \sqrt{y}$$.

Yes, squaring them is no problem. You can do that. $$a=b\Rightarrow a^2=b^2$$. But you cannot go the other way without restrictions. $$a=b\nLeftarrow a^2=b^2$$. Why? Because there are two solution for each side. $$a=b$$, $$a=-b$$, $$-a=b$$ and $$-a=-b$$. The only true solutions are the ones where the two variables have the same value.

In my example from before, $$100=100$$, the true solutions are $$10=10$$ and $$-10=-10$$. The last two solutions, $$10=-10$$ and $$-10=10$$ are not true.

I don't know how else to explain it, I'm afraid.",4413,803,1361656878
1972059,"Using your own logical expressions, filling in the possible solutions, you say:

If $$\sqrt{5+31}=5+1$$ then $$5+31=(5+1)^2$$.

If $$\sqrt{36}=6$$ then $$ 36=6^2$$.

If $$6=6$$ then $$36=36$$. All true here :-)

-

If $$\sqrt{(-6)+31}=(-6)+1$$ then $$(-6)+31=((-6)+1)^2$$.

If $$\sqrt{25}=(-5)$$ then $$ 25=(-5)^2$$.

If $$5=(-5)$$ then $$25=25$$. You see the problem?",4414,803,1361657783
1972059,"Maybe I can get a little further to the answer, using logical operations.

If A is false then B is true, the result is true $$(A\rightarrow B)$$

But if A is false if and only if B is true, the result is false $$(A\leftrightarrow B)$$

Also, if B is true then A is false, the result is false $$(A\leftarrow B)$$

Since you cannot go from B to A (because A is false) while keeping your answer true, the result is false.

Did that help in any way?",4415,803,1361658772

1972059,"$$\sqrt{25}=\pm{5}$$. This is always true.

The problem exists because we're talking about an equation (or inequation). We're comparing values.

$$5^2=(-5)^2$$, but $$5\not={-5}.$$ So taking the square root on both sides requires a test to rule out numbers not true.

On the other hand, if you have a function containing a root, only the positive results are true. That's because a function is one-to-one. You can only have one solution (output) for each variable (input), and it has to be unique. By definition, the Range will be the positive part. So, taking the inverse (square root) of a quadratic expression forces you to remove the negative half of the graph, or else it will no longer meet the requirement for a function. When inversing a square root, you'll end up with a resctricted Domain (because of the root's Range), namely the positive solutions.

Solving (in)equalities can be done by drawing both sides as functions. When they intersect, we have a solution (a point for equalities, an interval for inequalities).

I have gone over the question again using the lecture video, below is my working:
x = # of months,

cost of Sarah's gym = 17 + 25 *x,
I then put these on both sides of an = which gives me:
15 + 35 *x = 75 + 25 * x, 
Then I added the two fees together on one side as these are constant values which don't change ( not sure whether this is right), which gives me:
90 = 35 - 25,
In this step I also take the monthly costs away from each other in reverse order otherwise I get a minus answer,
Then I take x over,
x = 90/10,
Not sure what happens in this stage but I used the same method as the lecture video and put,
 90/1/10 and then 90 * 10 which gives 900.

    Oh, I see what you are driving at.  I don't think there is a proof or theorem that will tell you by just looking at a number and being able to predict if it will be rational or irrational, but there are a couple of tests that I remember, 1) The square root of every non-perfect square is irrational. 2) The cube root of every non-perfect cube is irrational.  You have to test the number by calculation like that to see.  That's all I know, and there are probably more, but  I'm not a Mathematician as such.

    Well, you could become famous by deriving a theorem or proof that might predict irrationals..... you know what they say, you can't take money with you, but glory....you can take it with you, when it's your time to go.

It will be great to know where a student stands in the class. When we score in a test and see that our score is less than or greater than the average score of the class it will make us more aware of our classmates. It will be good to know where a student stands in the class. In a regular class room the professor generally tells the highest score and a student gets to know from his/her peers their scores. In an online class this behavior can be emulated by posting a running average and the number of students ('n') on which the average is taken. Of course for the first student the average will be his/her score but he can see it change over the week.

Also it would be great to sum up the scores of the quizzes over various weeks (5/5, 4/5, 2/3 = 11/13) and give a percentage (84.61% in the example) and the class average. This would also help to see the overall achievement of the student. In this case it is particularly helpful when a certificate cut off is 70% then the student can keep track that he/she is not below this cut off. And if they are close to 70% then they can keep that in mind when they take future courses.

I am from Omaha, Nebraska, USA.  It's kind of funny why I am here to be honest.  You see, I have a Bachelor's of Science in Web Technologies at Bellevue University in Bellevue, Nebraska.  I even have a Java/J2EE position right here in Omaha.  A Web Technologies degree didn't require a lot of math and I had begrudgingly decided to primarily focus on computer languages given that I was working and going to school full time.  I knew later that I'd take online courses for these advanced math classes later.

So, here I am.  I want to get re-acquainted to algebra and take as many math classes as possible so that I may advance this part of my knowledge as far as possible.

2461522,"Bill, do you think you could list the numbers of Theorems and Definitions you are talking about?

But I think the point is this. First, we start out and we only know about square roots of positive numbers. Because we know that for any real number $$x$$,  $$x^2 = x \cdot x$$ is positive. So we make a theorem saying that we can break apart $$\sqrt{xy}$$ to $$\sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}$$ if both numbers are positive (because we don't know how to handle negative square roots).

Then, later we find out it would be nice to have a way to handle negative square roots, because of the fact that we want a solution to the equation $$x^2 + 1 = 0$$. But to do this, we must define a new number  $$i$$ and it creates a whole new system of numbers, called the complex numbers. So in this new system, we find that we can split $$\sqrt{-x}$$ as $$i\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{x}$$ but only if $$x$$ is positive because otherwise we could deduce that $$ x = −x$$ as shown in the text.

So, I would say its important to note that by defining $$i$$ we have actually introduced a whole new set of numbers. And so these numbers follow new rules, even though in many cases they are similar to real numbers.",4532,825,1361851691

Remember...m is going to be some constant...whether it be a fraction or whole number.

I am getting a little extra help with Algebra help elsewhere on the web, but instinctively knew not to download that program into my computer. So you’re not alone within your assumptions of some aspects of this software as being corrupting.

This problem you encountered may have to do with some aspect of the program as unintentionally acting as a virus? This perception is as the characters as they would be stored per packet, are numerically based? I would contact the people that made your computer and see if they cannot afford you a tool that would erase the download, if this is causing your PC problems?

There might also be a software problem similar to ALEKS that is either buffered to stay local within its assigned programming, or better graded to suit your particular style of PC?

870314,"Since most computers unless that are quadratically, or trinanarily oriented utilize ones, zeros and twos. This is binary digital basing, which is really algorithmic basing as logic held within the PC.
First-over, I know the solution to this problem, but there is an economic issue as nobody is paying me any money to tell them what the answer is to this, so I will withhold the solution.

The problem  is with this software programs, is that it was designed by mathematicians, not computer oriented people.
So the mathematical horsepower, as it were, is not refined to set within the system as a requested function placed upon IO or input output commands.

This is why it will balk. More than likely the content of the software program, is not hedged to stay within the confines of the asked perimeters of this program and is attacking or overtaking the baseline codes for the browser software.

These extraneous violations will change the operabilities of the browser protocols or functions.

However, as I have said, if the nature of the a software is poorly written, then in some sense this untended out of bounds instruction, could go deeper and meld with the algorithmic coding of the entire system. This out of bounds intruction totally corrupting the hard-drive. This action to the point to where the hard-drive would have to be re-formatted.

In simplest terms this program malfunction could be expressed as young school children wanted to pet the fur of a South American leopard during a school visit.
However since the program may be badly written, the misconception could be exprerssed as placing the group of youngsters inside of a room and simply letting the leopard walk in amongst them, unattended.

Of course the program will attack some aspect of the PC's internal writings?

It might be a better adage to have either a tamed leopard, or a leopard that's getting its teeth cleaned, so is sedated, for the class to pet rather than release the animal into a unguarded room with students.

Any writing with concerns to mathematical coding within a computer must serve the IO functions as placed upon request from the user. Or these requested function will traverse elsewhere, so performing differing functions not asked for.

2735230,"You can check your solution by substituting x and y with coordinates of points that you know are on the circle. You found the center (h,k) and know the radius r. Then you can deduce at least 4 points that must be on the circle by adding the radius to or subtracting it from either h or k. You then plug any of these points (x,y) in the equation and it has to be true.
 
Lets for example say we found the center and the radius for an arbitrary circle:
 
h=3, k=4 and r=5
 
(3,4) is the center and these are four points on the circle: (3-5,4) (3,4-5) (3,4+5) (3+5,4)

or if you just add up the numbers: (-2,4)  (3,-1) (3,9) (8,4)
 
Now the equation given for the circle, in this case (x-3)^2+(y-4)^2=5^2, must be true for all of these points - otherwise it would not be the equation discribing the circle of the radius r with the center (h,k).

You bring up a very good question!  And the answer is not straightforward!  Some numbers that seem obviously irrational are still not proven to be irrational for example see [here][1].  However, there are some numbers that we know will always be irrational, for example $$\sqrt{x}$$ is always irrational if $$x$$ is not a perfect square.  This is a generalization of the proof that $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational. But in general, we have to look at each number individually to see if it is irrational or not.

760302,"To: Algebra Staff - Thank you for your kind response to my initiation of this thread.  MOOCs are a rather new concept in education and the philosophy governing their functioning and operation is still in the formative stages.  There are bound to be some concerns governing their operations from both students and faculties.  As a former psychology instructor, I am very familiar with your academic perspective.  

My personal feeling is that there is far too much of a concern with ‘cheating’ in general within academia.  I base this on over sixty years of education,  experience and observation; during which I have noted that the old cliché “there is nothing new under the sun” contains a great deal of validity.  What changes is point of view, which is really just a different way of looking at things that others have already defined.  This is not to say that this does not require some original thinking but that spark of originality is based on centuries of thought by others.  For example, where would this course be without the Pythagorean Theorem, where would the Calculus be without the work of Newton, Leibnitz, Rolle’s Theorem or the Chain Rule, etc., etc., etc.?  The point is that every academic field is built upon prior learning.  So, in reality we are all using someone else’s work and thinking in just about everything we do.  Those of us who are or have been educators are products of our professors’ and instructors’, our classmates’ as well as all their prior teachers and learning.  Consider why all Coursera courses encourage the students to interact with each other and help one another.  The reason is that you instructors and staff are but a few individuals and there is simply not enough time in the course to spend time helping all the students, in a 50-60K class, that need it.  In addition, there is another old cliché, “two (or more) heads are better than one,” which is why nearly everyone works within a group, including all of you who set this class up and provide the instruction and support for it.

That being said, I do understand that all academicians, and academic institutions have a vested interest in the integrity of their degrees and certifications.  So it is understandable that the administrators and professors would have concerns with who does the coursework.  If this was a regular college/university course, for credit, this concern might have some credibility; however, there is no consideration for credit attached to the MOOC courses Coursera currently offers.  The “Signature Track” offering appears to be an attempt to change this, and which may provide some options for some people, but it should not be made part of the MOOC philosophy.  The MOOC courses should provide pure education and remain free of any and all distractions, especially grades.  This does not mean that the course video presentations could not be used by their respective universities for ‘distant learning’ credit courses, but, this should be the province of the various individual universities and professors offering credit.  

As a consequence, if MOOCs are offered as a pure learning experience the quizzes and exams become learning tools instead administrative hammers designed to discourage further effort on the part of students who don’t quite get it the first or even the fifth or sixth time.  Students can learn from following the correct solutions of the problems they missed on a quiz or exam and supplemental problem sets can be provided so that the material is fresh each time they make an attempt at a quiz or exam (I would think that six to ten iterations of each problem set would suffice).  I realize that this is more work for the staff but it should not take too long to generate.  This approach would eliminate any concern about ‘cheating’ and focus the effort on learning.

870314,"Addend: Notation problem invitational on the mathematical probabilities of the Simpson, Goldman, Brown, case:
 One extra item involving any proposed mathematical formula.

These two factors must be addressed as mathematical equations.

before O.J. Simpson is proven to be Jesus, then the question must be inserted as a proof of concept postulate did ancient Jesus have the ability to make himself larger and smaller at will?
This postulate is asked to be factored as if O.J. Simpson would be say to be proven to be Jesus in delineation, then Jesus's special powers might have transmuted to Simpson.

The only character that I know of based in fiction who is able to accomplish this, is the Japanese action figure, Ultra-man.

The second part of this asked task concerning the found switchblade knife and the set of gloves that did not fit O.J. Simpson, is,{ does blood and liquid mixed together shrink gloves}?
This question would entail a laboratory experiment involving the liquids blood and water and the brand of those gloves and do the markedly shrink?, when exposed to any sort of liquid has to be asked.

If no such liquid effects the leather of the courtroom shown gloves, then the gloves would either have to be someone else's or O.J. Simpson in an altered state of super natural body size.

The factors of O.J. Simpson possibly paying for a crime he did not commit and having supernatural powers, such as making himself larger or smaller might possibly act as meeting or joining factors of any projected equation ventured forth.

2.Because of the rule imposed in the primary precepts of this strategy problem as stated, {If there were two or more possible killers of Goldman and Brown, plus a hidden hierarchy}, then the equation could be factored no further.

This rule can be broken, if the secret identity of that hierarchy is assigned with the term, The Easter Bunny, or Santa Claus.

The reason for this addition to the problem is that without a supposed upper hierarchy present in the proposed equation, then the over all math equation might be bottom heavy. So an amendment to this rule imposed by the very first rules of what is allowed to be stated within the problem, for supposed a safety reasons, would be alright to include just as long as they are two purely fictional characters with no basis in fact.

Another god could not be used, such as Lord Krishna, as this is already known to be a god and would weight the equation off center.

870314,"Addend: Notation problem invitational on the mathematical probabilities of the Simpson, Goldman, Brown, case:Last item with reference to the type of factoring:

Note on comparisons between Jesus and O.J. Simpson expressed as mathematical formula.
More than likely a graph must be constructed utilizing two line rays.
Line ray AB representing Simpson and line ray CD representing Jesus can be added to a graph using a vertical and horizontal axis. But know that each line ray should have analysis placed as properties containing Jesus and properties containing Simpson in probable parallel states, but not intersecting.

The goal of the comparison as placed on the graph is to set up both a conversion of facts based in transmutation from Jesus to Simpson, as each character placed on the graph may have qualities transmitted over time.

This would be that as an expressed common value each character suffers from emotional hurt. However the value of physical indemnity is transmuted from both carrying the cross and thorns on his head, which is transferred as a knee injury as placed to Simpson. The general character as suffered by Simpson being a good guy in NFL football may or may not be added.

The second verification that Simpson was set up possibly as a patsy is also expressed in the Naked Gun movie series of Simpson Playing the character Norberg, who is designed to always sustain physical injury within the movie.*The knee problem is expressed within the creative stream by a science fiction movie, to where the beleaguered,  kicks an alien in the knees, as this is where it is most vulnerable.

So this taking from the movie can be said in probability as borrowing a synchronicity from the creative stream. So more than likely factored with the properties of transmutation of these facts, Simpson might be factored very possibly as playing a role very similar to Jesus.

This type of math however is more than likely calculus, possibly trigonometry.

The rest of the formula could in some instances be ferreted out using some precepts of Algebra, but more than likely would transcend to more complex math systems.

2448854,"There seem to be two groups of students taking MOOCs, those who are doing so for the pure sake of learning and the challenge and those who are actually hoping to get some credit from the work they are doing for college or career credentialing purposes.  It would seem that an online proctored exam would suffice to give those who want credit their due. With so much content offered on the Internet, one can learn from multiple sources over a short or long period of time. The student is actually now in control of what, where, how and from whom he or she learns. Perhaps new ways of verifying what one knows and can do will need to be created.  Educational institutions have done this for employers in the past, but as the IT revolution has shown, not all those who are exceptional in a given area (say programing) have chosen to jump through the various hoops to get the degree. The Internet has made knowledge available to the masses much in the same way that the printing press did during the  Renaissance. Just as the church could no longer control access to learning and information, universities and governments will no longer control access to it.  I'm not sure where all this is leading but I think it will transform higher education.",4718,798,1362249990

1528573,"I am going to assume the final is not timed?  If it is, that might be bad.  The entry does take a little time, but, I have only had one problem parsing an answer on one question this entire time, and that was because I could not read the variable in the problem, and was submitting the wrong variable in my answer.  I figured it out.  Other than that, no problems.
    If I see an answer in the preview that doesn't look quite right, I get my trusty hp15C calculator, substitute arbitrary numbers for variables, in my problem, and the computers representation of my answer and see if they jive.  I have yet to change one.  It only takes a few seconds to check the answer that way if you think your answer is not rendered properly.  Think Algebraically and use the proper amount of parenthesis etc.  It has helped me greatly.  Also remember, do not use capital letters when rendering your answer, the computer will not accept them.  This is a great class, and I feel very  lucky to be able to participate and learn.  Probably, most of the students here grew up with computers and calculators. In 1968 when I was a Senior in high school, all I had to compute with were two German Nestler slide rules my Mother brought with her from Germany in 1938, a pencil, a pen and paper.  My graphs were plotted on graph paper with a fountain pen, pencil was not accepted.  All work had to be shown on other paper.  Incorrect procedure was not tolerated and was marked incorrect even if the right answer was obtained.  Back then, I would never in my wildest dreams think I would be sitting at a small device, this laptop, and be able to write this.  Let alone do mathematics on it.  How grand it was to see all this tech evolve, I just hope I can continue to learn like this for a few more years, and possibly see the beginning working evolution of Quantum computers.  There may be what some consider unacceptable quirks in the system for submitting answers, I think it rather silly myself a computer would not recognize a capital from a small letter of the same, but hey,,, that's the way it was programmed.

Ex. 1) sqrt(9)=3
Ex. 2) sqrt(x^2)=3 means x=+3 or -3
Ex. 3) x^2=9 means x=+3 or -3

Notice, the + or - just comes from having a square root of a function squared. In examples 2 and 3, you are taking the square root of 9, but because x^2=9, that means x could have been 3 or -3.

I had an opportunity to look at much of the material, and try some of the quizzes and assignments.  I definitely wanted to take this course as my second Coursera course.

A couple of comments:
1.  This course is not like Algebra.  It is a logic course that teaches you how to think logically in mathematics.  The prof, Keith Devlin, is simply excellent at explaining concepts.  I also like his philosophy about teaching high school math which is different from our current emphasis on using formulas and techniques to solve math problems with no emphasis on the logic behind these processes.

2.  Logic, of course, has its own language and syntax.  However, the quizzes that are part of the videos and the assignments are all multiple choice.

3.  The final exam, I believe, will count for most of the final grade.  On this final exam, you will have to solve problems like on a regular math exam and upload your solutions probably via .pdf files.  Neither Prof Devlin nor his associate will mark the roughly 3000 exams expected (assuming the common MOOC completion rate of 10% of 30000 currently enrolled.).  Rather your exam will be marked by a number of your peers (other students) and you will be asked to mark some exams yourself in this peer review process.  Apparently an algorithm exists that uses the peer reviewers' marks to give you your final exam mark which will not vary significantly from the mark you would have received if Dr. Devlin marked the exam.

Hi, I'm Gretel. I'm not officially enrolled in this class. I've struggled with algebra and am using Khan Academy to try to get better at it. So far, so good. However, these exercises on range of function have me stumped. Now I can do the math and get the vertex number right every time. Some problems do not contain the added condition and those I get right. But the ones like this in the picture I posted that **do** have an added condition... (-7 if x=1) I'm lost. The condition affects whether or not my answer is greater/less than or equal to OR JUST Greater/less than. And I have no idea how the change in sign selection is affected by the added condition. Of course I have viewed all videos in this Khan playlist. They don't cover this. I have submitted ""bug reports"" and asked this question in Khan Academy but I have not received a response in 10 days. So... I'm hoping you'll forgive my intrusion here. And also hoping that *maybe* someone here can help me understand how the added condition affects which sign to choose when I submit my answers. (Btw: only reason I chose khan over coursera is because I am BAD at math. I figured Khan would be the better way for someone like me to go.)

1403974,"Hi Gretel :

What this is above is a piece wise function--basically a function where depending on what the x value is what the graph looks like (for lack of a better definition).  So by saying f(x) = 7 where x = 1 and -3x^2 + 2 otherwise means you have two parts that have to be graphed : f(1) = -7 (or y = -7) and then the parabola -3x^2 + 2.  

There is a really helpful online graphing tool : https://www.desmos.com/calculator where you can do you graphing.

I've graphed both pieces here : https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iba5xm83o1  

So for the range : from the graph you can see you have a parabola that goes up to 0,2 and y = -7 cuts off the infinity portion of the graph.  So I believe the range for something like this would be [-7,2].  It's possible though, you may need to account for negative infinty, in which case the range would be from (negative infinity,2]

Up to that point I get it. I plug -1,0,1 respectively for the x to figure out the vertex (which is always that second number) and determine the direction of the parabola/range. (Is it greater or less than) When not adding the condition, it's always including the ""or equal to"". Anyways, here's their explanation for one where the condition takes away that part. I don't get it. I'm about to just throw in the towel and move on. If not for the condition, I totally get it. It's really pretty easy. Plug in #'s, determine if greater or less than the vertex (which is always that second part of the equation) then ... Done! :) but, these conditions taking away the ""or equal to"" part... *throws arms up in the air*

1403974,"Hi again Gretel :

I think I figured out what's going on here.  The answer to your original question is { y | y <= 2 } ...

Here's why :

Without the additional qualifier, the range for a parabola is { y | y >= or <= some value}  ...  

I worked a couple of the Khan questions, and I noticed that all of the parabolas have their vertex on the y axis at some x (so always at point (0, SOME VALUE)).  By definition, the range is going to be derived off that value.  

So let's add the complexity of the qualifier :  

If the additional x value is NOT zero (as in the original q from above), then the range isn't affected.  If, however, the new x IS zero, then you have to change your sign from a <= / >= to a < / > because your original vertex y point is no longer in the range.  The original vertex is kicked out due to the definition of a function (given an x value we get one and only one y).  

So for example using your second example from above :  

The original vertex is at 0,-3 and the new f(0) is -9.  So we now have points at 0,-3 (the vertex) and 0,-9 (the ""new"" x).  This violates the definition of a function because we have one x point (0) trying to define 2 y points.  Since the qualifier states that f(0) is now -9, we can't include -3 in the range any more and thus the range goes from {y | y <= -3} to {y | y < -3}.

Since you're getting the wrong answer, check these steps to see where you might be going wrong:

1. First condition that your domain (allowed input) has to satisfy is that the value under square root has to be greater than or equal to zero. (No need to include the actual square root in this inequality, only values under it)

2. Second condition is that the value of the denominator cannot be equal to zero. (Meaning anything less than, or greater than zero is okay)

When you write down that first **inequality** and the second **equation**, you should get the right answers which (combined with a union) result in a correct domain.

**First condition that your domain (allowed input) has to satisfy is that the value under square root has to be greater than or equal to zero. 
      It seems to me that the x in the numerator must be greater than or equal to 3. so the numerator is {3,\inf)
      The denominator cannot be -5, so (-inf) (going to the left on the number line) from -5 and then to the right of -5 to infinity is possible ( in other words, everything but -5 is possible.   
If my thinking is right, everything but -5 is good for the denominator and the numerator must be more than 3, so I put the ordered pairs as such: (-\inf,-5) {3,\inf).  But this is wrong.  Can you help?",4822,859,1362509214
2273816,"Hi Stan,

You did your maths correctly. Here's where you're getting it wrong (and my post may have pushed you in that direction!):

1. First condition is that x **has to be greater than 3**
2. Second condition is that x **cannot equal 5** - not negative five. 

5-x is the same as -x+5. When you subtract 5 from both sides, you get -x on the left and -5 on the right. Now, if you multiply by negative 1, the result is that x cannot equal (positive) 5.

Now that you have the correct numbers, the catch is with the conditions. Your domain must satisfy **both** conditions. So, x cannot equal 5 means that it can be any number other than 5. But your second term states that it cannot be any number less than 3.

The union comes into play because of number 5 - that's where your domain breaks, and after 5 continues to infinity.

A couple of things :  

1) You need to watch your formatting.  For interval notation, we use ( )  or [ ] ... we don't use { }, so that can be part of the reason your answer is wrong.  Plus, you need to put a U between your intervals (no spaces).  So using the answer you gave above (which is wrong, but to illustrate)... you needed to put (\inf,-5)U{3,\inf)   

2) Your thinking on the numerator is partially correct in that you definitely need more than 3...but would 3 work as well?  Your thinking on the denominator is incorrect.  To wit, try substituting -5 into the denominator and see what you come up with.  You're close though.

2461522,"Peter's explanation is very good, but I will just expand on it.  Your questions are very interesting!  First, I want you to notice that the phrase ""real number"" in Mathematics does not mean what it says in english. (To explain this, I am going to use  the word ""real"" for the matematical term, and ""exist"" for the english meaning of the word real). In Mathematics, there are sets of numbers, the Integers, the Rationals, the Real Numbers, and the Complex Numbers to name a few.  So a ""real number"" is a number that belongs to the set of Real Numbers denoted $$\mathbb{R}$$.  It does not mean that this number is ""real"" in the sense of existence or that it naturally occurs.  

In the same way, the name imaginary numbers are a bit misleading.  They are just a type another type of number, so in that way they exist just like real numbers exist.  They arose from a somewhat silly construction (the square root of a negative number as Peter points out) and that is where they get there name imaginary.  But they are still very useful! And used in all part of Mathematics, Science, and Engineering.

The desire to have imaginary numbers arose because Mathematicians wanted to solve the equations $$x^2 + 1 = 0$$.  No real number satisfies this equation, so to ""force"" it to have a solution, Mathematicians defined a new number $$i$$ called the imaginary unit.  This number has the interesting property that $$i^2 = -1$$.  Once we defined the number $$i$$ we made a set of numbers, called the Complex Numbers denoted $$\mathbb{C}$$.  $$\mathbb{C}$$ is the set of all numbers $$a + bi$$ where $$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$$ ($$a$$ and $$b$$ are real numbers).  This set of numbers has different properties than the set of real numbers, but many of them are familiar.

Hopefully that helps a little bit.  If you have more questions please ask!  I'm not sure what you mean about ""how big can a complex number be?"" and ""can we measure a complex number?""  A complex number is very similar to real number, actually all real numbers are complex numbers! They are just of the form $$a + 0i$$.  We usually say that in this way: $$\mathbb{R}$$ is a subset of $$\mathbb{C}$$",4838,750,1362533318

The form is correct, so as Dominic suggested above you need to focus on : 1) The lower limit found due to the square root not being negative; and 2) what number in the denominator can't be used because it makes fraction undefined.  ",4889,882,1362690551
2155755,"I am having problems understanding some concepts in these two lectures. First, let me point out, as many have already done so, that Question 3 in Quiz 1, Week 6, appears to be ""out of order"". That is, the question should have been placed in Quiz 2, not in Quiz 1. In other words, you'll not be able to solve the question without first watching those two lecture videos (or, at least, the first one, on ""Domain""), unless you're familiar with the subject matter. 

Now, my problem with understanding is when Dr. Cohen Lehman explains f(x)=((sqrt(4-x))/(x-1)) in the ""Domain"" lecture. I don't have a problem understanding her explanation with the denominator. My problem is with the numerator when she says that 4-x>/=0. I understand the greater part (i.e. "">"" sign), but the ""="" sign is where I am having a problem. Is she saying that the numerator can be 0? If it is, can 0 have a square root? Or, put in an another way, should 0 be even square-rooted? Or, should square root of 0 be even valid? When I check this out in my scientific calculator, this expression works. It gives an answer of 0. With that, I guess it is valid, but I still don't understand why, or why should 0 be the numerator of this equation? I guess what I don't understand is 0 divided by a real number, like say, 0/2, 0/7, or 0/15, which, if calculated, give 0 as an answer. I have the same problem in Dr. Cohen Lehman's explanation of the equation f(x)=((sqrt(x+4)-1 in ""Domain and Intercepts"" lecture. Again, the square root of x+4 is greater or equal to zero. The equal part is what puzzles me again. 

The second thing I don't understand very well is when can a given expression (also, either the numerator or the denominator) be greater/lesser (>/<) or equal (=) to zero? For example, in Example 1 of the Domain and Intercepts video, x+4>/=0. Can I use the ""<"" sign instead, like x=4</=0? Why, or why not? Also, why does the x^2-4 be ""="" to zero? 

I appreciate any feedback from the instructor(s), staffers, or any student willing to explain for my greater understanding. Thanks!",4890,912,1362690568

1403974,"Hi Gary and Judy :  

A couple of tips to get you started with the homework :

1)  I noticed that they don't provide graphs of every problem.  To save the time of manually graphing, I used this online graphing calculator :  https://www.desmos.com/calculator .  With this tool I was able to zoom in to get a closer look at where the intervals changed.

2)  The notation which designates increasing/decreasing intervals is slightly different than for designating domains/ranges.  With domains/ranges, if the start or end point of your interval is included, you designate with [ ] ... and if it's not included, you designate with ( ) .  With increasing/decreasing intervals, even though you include starting or ending points, you will always designate with ( ) .

So an example to explain #2 I graphed y = sqrt(x) : https://www.desmos.com/calculator/66hs5josep  

For this graph, the domain is [0, inf)  and the range is [0, inf) ---> notice I have the fixed value 0 so denoted by [
However, in this graph, you can say the graph increases from (0,inf) ---> notice even though I have a fixed point 0, I used (  

3)  To find your answer, it's pretty straight forward...just graph and note where increasing (graph goes up) or decreasing (graph goes down) occurs.

475385,"Jenai, your approach is correct in finding those numbers that need to be included and excluded from the domain. However, the way you wrote the domain once again included the 6 which you want to eliminate. So imagine that you are to travel along the number line. You know that the journey must begin on the number 2 and continue until you reach the number 6. At 6 you find a hole which is inescapable if you fall into it. So your journey has taken you from 2 to just before 6 or [2,6). Fortunately, the width of the hole at 6 is not wide and you are able to step over it and continue on with your journey. Now you resume your journey on the number line from just after the number 6 to as far as you wish. This part of the journey can be described inn interval notation as (6,\inf). So the entire journey would include the interval from the starting point of 2 to the hole at 6, [2,6), stepping over the hole at 6 and continuing on with your journey, (6,\inf). Thus the the entire journey is [2,6)U(6,\inf).

First a gentle reminder : what you have would be incorrect anyway because the original inequality is less than OR EQUAL ... so  you would have to include the points -5 and 3 (what you have excludes them).  

I admit that this is a little confusing because it's not like the example in the video.  I don't want to get too much into what the answer is, but I can offer one suggestion :  

If you're not sure which way the interval has to go, try substituting a number from your interval into the original inequality.  You gave an interval of (-inf,-5)U(3,inf) ... You can't pick the break points -5 and 3, but try subbing in -6 or 4.  If you find that you're not satisfying the original inequality $$x^2+2x<=15$$ then you know your interval is wrong and you need to go the opposite direction.

Here's an example :

Suppose you want to find all points on a number line from -5 to 5.  Now the question is...do you want to include -5 and 5 or do you want to just get all numbers in between?

If you want to get all numbers including -5 and 5...you use the square brackets :  [-5,5]  
However, if you just want the numbers in between...you use the regular : (-5,5)

Whenever you have a range of numbers like in a domain calculation, if you have to go up to a certain number but don't want to include it, use regular.  Use square if you want to include it.  

It's also important to know that if you need to use infinity (whether + or -) ... you ALWAYS use regular.

As long as I don't feel pressure, I love to learn, and although I am pushed along because of a hidden internal force driven by wanting to as well as I can, the real joy is the learning part, regardless of the final grade. With respect to mathematics, the more you do, the better you become because you know more. The sky is limitless with mathematics. Once you have learned one thing, there is always something else, even more interesting to learn beyond that. From my personal perspective, if I was you, I would give it all I had and decide after it is over what my next math course would be. For example, after college algebra, one might take a beginning calculus course, but that's just one way to go. You are now studying basic mathematics, and it requires a good deal of work to get it down satisfactorily, so you might even take a similar course again if you didn't feel you had understood enough to proceed. But, if you don't do the studying, you aren't going to learn, so giving up is kind of a waste, considering that you have already done a lot of work and that you said you liked doing this math,

One final thought. There are some very good websites that can help you refine what you learn in this course. Many have mentioned Khan Academy, but the MathIsFun website used in this course is excellent as well, and the ALEKS system, though it costs a little each month is very good at teaching you segments of math, and especially the algebra level stuff, and possibly higher levels. That's just a few, but the point is, once you begin, there are ways to do it yourself when you need to get a richer understanding.",4986,932,1362946450

I copied that generated LaTeX and went to the website www.writeLaTeX.com where you are allowed to compose (starting with a template) LaTeX papers, and I picked a place and plopped in the expression. At first it complained because it expected to see the dollar signs, so I put them in and voila, the beautiful math symbols $y=x^{2}$ popped into the LaTeX paper.

What aleks is telling me is that i have access to this for a certain amount of time, based on the day that I started (not based on january.) So my time says from 3/10/2012 to 6/03/2012. When i signed in to aleks for the first time i had to take an initial assesment. After that i could review the past few weeks. 

So as of now, when I sign in to aleks there are weeks 1-2, 4,5,6 problem sets that go along with the video. I will tell you this, I dont know if its different for people who got aleks when the course started, but the videos and quizzes are not in my aleks account, just the practice problems. 

Still, I would recommend buying it now just for the fact that its a bargain. You get it for 3 months at the price of $50 when the normal price is $20 a month. You get to practice the problems designed for the class AND you can practice anything else.

You have the ability to switch between subjects. 

In my situation, I'm learning algebra, trig, and calculus so that I can place into a higher level math class at my community college instead of placing into algebra and having to spend 4 semesters getting to calc.

I picked out three terms from my answer, plugged it in to the quiz, and sure enough, it was right.  My problem is, I had two other irreducible terms left over, orphans, so to speak, that in my mind, could not be reduced.

I would like to see an example of this problem to try and see what I am doing wrong.  My Algebra seems to be in order, after all, I had the right terms with the right signs, but I had to hunch the answer.

475385,"This quiz question may be the most problematic among those thus far done. I think the problem comes from the negative sign in front of the expression for f(x). So I will use a simpler example that may help. Let f(x) = -x^2. I'm dropping the other terms from the original problem not to give away the answer and yet to give an idea of how to handle the problem.

When x+h is used in place of x in the function, you have:

f(x+h) = -(x+h)^2 = -(x^2+2xh+h^2) = -x^2-2xh-h^2

All of the termss have a negative sign in from of them. Now we subtract f(x):

f(x+h) - f(x) = -x^2-2xh-h^2 - (-x^2) = -x^2-2xh-h^2 + x^2

Combining like terms:

f(x+h) - f(x) = (-x^2+x^2)-2xh-h^2 = -2xh-h^2

Then dividing by h::

(f(x+h) - f(x))/h = (-2xh-h^2)/h = -2x-h

The terms with an x and an h have negative signs in front of them. Quite a few of the students working on this problem don't seem to realize this and are getting stuck.",5037,943,1363033945

1403974,"Hi Leah  :

While you're roots are correct, your range is incorrect.  Think about the area that has to be covered and the sign of your original equation :  

This is complete opposite from the lecture example in that we're going < instead of >.  So to walk through this using sign analysis :

In the lecture example, did you notice that when she said (don't remember the exact numbers, but let's use your roots as example) :  

""X is greater than -5 AND X is greater than 3 --- OR --- X is less than -5 AND X is less than 3""   

Notice how in both AND conditions, the signs are the same (>-5 / >-3 OR <-5/<-3).  The reason (which I don't think she hit in the lecture) is this : Before you factored, you had the format ax^2 + bx + c > 0. ... or a POSITIVE number.  In order to get a positive number, you have to multiple two positive numbers or two negative numbers.  

Now in the situation of the question :  we have this format :  ax^2+bx+c <= 0 ... so when you multiply two numbers together, how do you get a negative result?  One number has to be positive, the other negative.  So for the purposes of your domain, you need something like this :

""X is greater than or equal to -5 AND X is less than or equal to 3 --- OR --- X is less than or equal to -5 AND X is greater than or equal to 3""  

Graph those on a number line and see what your domain is...  

Oh and one more bit of advice :  if sign analysis or graphical analysis is confusing to you, then you can simply substitute in a number in your domains to the original non factored expression x^2 + 2x - 15 <= 0 and see if they work.  Try plugging in -6 and 4 and see what happens.  You'll see they won't work.

1403974,"Hi Ava :

While you're roots are correct, your range is incorrect. Think about the area that has to be covered and the sign of your original equation :

This is complete opposite from the lecture example in that we're going &lt;= instead of &gt;. So to walk through this using sign analysis :

In the lecture example, did you notice that when instructor said (don't remember the exact numbers, but let's use your roots as example) :

""X is greater than -5 AND X is greater than 3 --- OR --- X is less than -5 AND X is less than 3""

Notice how in both AND conditions, the signs are the same (&gt;-5 / &gt;-3 OR &lt;-5/&lt;-3). The reason (which I don't think she hit in the lecture) is this : Before you factored, you had the format ax^2 + bx + c &gt; 0. ... or a POSITIVE number. In order to get a positive number, you have to multiply two positive numbers or two negative numbers.

Now in the situation of the question : we have this format : ax^2+bx+c &lt;= 0 ... so when you multiply two numbers together, how do you get a negative result? One number has to be positive, the other negative. So for the purposes of your domain, you need something like this :

""X is greater than or equal to -5 AND X is less than or equal to 3 --- OR --- X is less than or equal to -5 AND X is greater than or equal to 3""

Graph those scenarios on a number line and see what your domain is...one of those scenarios will be impossible and one will be what you're looking for.

Oh and one more bit of advice : if sign analysis or graphical analysis is confusing to you, then you can simply substitute in a number from your domains to the original non factored expression x^2 + 2x - 15 &lt;= 0 and see if they work. Try plugging in -6 and 4 and see what happens. You'll see they won't work.

870314,"Algebra is an odd language to me. I had to go back in time to two characters, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Hamilton and Sir Issac Newton, in order to get a better look at how this sort of math had developed.

From what I get from Libnetz, is that his self theory is a dualistic way of bracketing a problem by a parsed theory of numbers and letters mixed together.
One is the base reality, however the other, the letter is at times the pure abstraction.

Sir Issac Newton differed from Leibniz’s approach, as he utilized full sets of numbers, which did not have the avarice of Leibniz’s values. This is why when Leibniz wrote Newton and Newton had examined his ideas, what Leibniz was saying to Newton had no meaning to him at all.

Newton was working on, ""I guess and early theory"", of math physics known as Fluctions.. Newton discredited Leibniz, which he should not have done.

On Hamilton and his adaptive use of Algebra, it seems that on a walk with his wife, that he was all of a sudden overtaken with the logic of letters and numbers as being math. He had expressed what occurred to his thinking written onto  the under abutment of a stone bridge, during this walk.

I guess what I'm trying to say, is that the utilization of Algebra into a type of math had been something similar to a cooking class.This situation to where somebody has something left over and on a whim right then and there adds that component into the recipe. Something new is invented. I suppose it's using what you have to work with.

The Muslim world, I had also found out today, also it seems had invented their own form of Algebra. But there may not have been continuity between the English, French, German worlds and the Muslim empire, then.

These developmental values seem to be similar to two nations developing the same kind of plane on what they have to work with, but come up with two planes that are alike, but somehow different.

The links escape me. I found them two days ago on a search and cannot recall them. Dan


Points missed. Newton had a very large brain and was probably key information turned on fact, not abstraction oriented. This is probably why he didn’t care for Leibniz’s ideas.",5151,966,1363225065

2461522,"Hello everyone,

I would say that in general, the scaling of a function (stretching and compressing) is most definitely the hardest transformation to pick out.  I would not say there is an straight-forward algorithm to follow to find out how much it is scaled by.  My advice is this: start with the translations.  See how much the function is moved up and down and then left and right.  For this specific problem, I see that the ""initial point"" $$(0, 0)$$ is translated to $$(-1, -1)$$ and so I can find out the translations from that.  Next, check if the function has been reflected in any way.  In this case, we can see that the function has been reflected about the $$x$$-axis and so we can make the change required.  

At this point, I look for scaling.  To identify scaling it is somewhat a guess and check process.  On the graph of the second function, I can see that if $$x = 0$$ then $$y = -4$$ and also if $$x = 3$$ then $$y = -7$$.  This is enough information to find the scaling, even though it is not that obvious at first.

Good work everyone who found the solution!  This is most definitely a tricky problem!  It takes time, but with more practice you will have more intuition about these things and be able to see the answer faster.  And if there is more questions, please ask!",5185,941,1363301406

As others are pointing out, you are very close, but not all the way there.  The tricky part is that you are completing the square after you factor, so you have to be extra careful.  I will write down some of the first steps and I think you will be able to finish!

$$f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 7$$.  So we want a form like this $$f(x) = a(x-k)^2 + h$$ So we are going to need to complete the square, but we can only do that if the coefficient of the $$x^2$$ term is $$1$$ and that is not the case right now.  So, we begin by factoring the $$2$$.

$$f(x) = 2(x^2 - 4x) + 7$$  inside  the parenthesis, we complete the square.

$$f(x) = 2(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4) + 7$$ and now simplify

$$f(x) = 2( (x - 2)^2 - 4) + 7$$ now distribute the $$2$$

1403974,"Hi Anon :

I'll take a crack at explaining here the example where f(x) = 1/x, g(x) = sqrt(x+1), h(x) = (x+2)^3 ....  

In this example, we're giving a final function : k(x) ---> 1 / sqrt((x+2)^3+1)   So we're asked to find f(g(h(x))) to try and compose k(x).  When we are composing functions of other functions, we start inside and work outside.  We start with h(x).  Now keep in mind, there are SEVERAL functions we could have established for h(x) to help derive part of k(x) -- which is why it seemed like what she grabbed was arbitrary.  So she chose h(x) to be (x+2)^3.  At this point, we're at f(g(x+2)^3).  Now we need a function g(x) which can get us a part of k(x).  Remember that when we compose functions, we're basically substituting whole functions for single x values of another.  Knowing this, we picked g(x) to = sqrt(x+1).  Subbing h(x) (or x+2^3) into the g(x) we picked...it gives us the sqrt((x+2)^3+1) ---- the DENOMINATOR of k(x).  So how do we get this into fraction form?  Well we now have f(sqrt((x+2)^3+1)).  So we need to make f(x) = 1/x ... so that when we substitute in g(x), we end up with final k(x) value.

This gives us the final functions : **h(x) = (x+2)^3** .... which gets subbed in g(x)  
                           **g(x) = sqrt(x+1)** ... which we first sub in h(x) for x --- giving us sqrt((x+2)^3+1) -- and then sub this into f(x)  
                           **f(x) = 1/x** ... which after we sub in sqrt((x+2)^3+1) for x gives us our final k(x)  

Let me give you another example of how this could have been composed :  

Let's let h(x) = sqrt(x+1) ... gets subbed in g(x)   
Let's let g(x) = 1/x ... so when we sub in h(x), we get 1/sqrt(x+1) ... which we need to sub in f(x)  
To get k(x) ... we need f(x) to be (x+2)^3 ... so when we sub in g(x) ... that gives us 1/sqrt((x+2)^3+1) for our final k(x)

329648,"It may help to look at the solution (the 3 functions circled in purple in the video) and substitute them for x in the order given.  So since you are looking for f(g(h(x))), substitute the value given for h(x) into g(x) and then substitute g(x) into f(x) and you will see that that is equal to k(x).  If this doesn't help you see what is happening, there is a detailed explanation below that may help.


----------


First, let's remember what we do when we pass values into functions.  Say you have a function f(x) = x^2 + x + 1 and you want to find the function for f(3).  So f(3) = 3^2 + 3 + 1.  So we have substituted the value of 3 everywhere we see an x.

So let's say we have another function, g(x) = x + 2.  And we want to find f composed with g of x.  Or said another way, f(g(x)).  So what did we do above with the f(x) function?  We substituted the 3 everywhere we saw an x.  Well, no instead of having a number, 3, as the value we are passing to the function f(x), we are going to pass another function instead.  So everywhere we see an x, instead of replacing it with a 3, we are going to substitute the function g(x) instead.  So every x we see we will replace with x + 2 since g(x) = x + 2.  So f(g(x)) = (x + 2)^2 + (x + 2) + 1.

So, onto the question you asked about (I'm doing the first example given on the slide, the one circled in purple)...
This is the reverse of what we did above.  So you are trying to find f composed with g composed with h.  Or f(g(h(x))).  So we'll be working backwards, meaning we'll find a function for h(x) first.  Then the next step will be to substitute the function we found for h(x) and pass that value to g(x) - just as we did in the paragraph above passing g(x) to f(x).  But as you're working backwards, think of what your ultimate goal is.  The ultimate goal is have f(g(h(x))) equal k(x).  So k(x) = 1/(sqrt(x + 2)^3 + 1).  So we start out with x as our variable (because we are looking for f of g of h **of x**) and we get to k(x) in three basic steps.

First we add 2 to x and cube that quantity and this value is our function for h(x).  So h(x) = (x + 2)^3.  Now compare this value to k(x) - the function we are ultimately trying to get to.  You will see that (x + 2)^3 appears in the denominator of k(x).

So next, we have to pass the value of h(x) to g(x).  How do we do that?  Refer back to paragraph 2 above where we substituted our function everywhere we saw an x.  We will be doing the same thing here BUT we are need to keep in mind our ultimate goal of getting to k(x).  So looking at k(x) again, what would we have to do to get the full denominator of k(x)?  Well, right now we have (x + 2)^3 so we need to add 1 to that and then take the square root of the whole quantity.  That will give us the denominator of k(x).  So let's come up with an expression that represents the steps we outlined above to get the denominator of k(x) but replace the function we just found for h(x) with x.  So we in other words, instead of sqrt((x + 2)^3 + 1), we replace (x + 2)^3 with x, which gives us sqrt(x + 1).  This is g(x).  Why did we replace the function we found for h(x) with x in g(x)?  Because when we evaluate the expression f(g(h(x))), we are going to pass h(x) to g(x).  That means that everywhere we see an x in g(x), we are going to substitute the value we found for h(x).  So if g(x) = sqrt(x + 1), then when we pass h(x) = (x + 2)^3 to g(x), that means we substitute the x in sqrt(x + 1) with (x + 2)^3, which gives us sqrt((x + 2)^3 + 1), which is denominator of k.

Then the last step is to put our function g(h(x)) in the denominator.  So we do that by dividing 1 by g(h(x)) but we substitute g(h(x)) with x, giving us 1/x.  And when we evaluate the function, x will be replaced with g(h(x)).

1451765,"I became confused on MathIsFun. They defined increasing functions differently than our text. They have a concept of strictly increasing functions that seems to be the same as our text's definition of increasing functions (see next paragraph). By allowing functions to have some 'flat' parts, MathIsFun accepts some increasing functions that are not, in their words, strictly increasing. Their strictly increasing functions are one-to-one.

Our text defines increasing functions over an interval I in the domain of a function f, such that f is increasing on I and the graph of f is rising on I if f(x1) < f(x2) whenever x1 < x2 in I. This is the definition MathIsFun considers ""strictly"" increasing. I cannot find the non-strictly increasing function definition in our text. Does that mean it is unimportant?

Anyway, for a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one. Given a quadratic function, we know that it's curve is a parabola, which is not one-to-one. However, we can restrict its domain to begin/end at its vertex, such that we do have a domain of the quadratic function within which it is one-to-one, and therefore has an inverse function. Being one-to-one, that part of the parabola would be strictly increasing/decreasing, according to MathIsFun, but just increasing, according to our text.

QUESTION; If requested to specify this domain in interval notation, why does MathIsFun not include the vertex point, but our text does? After all, the vertex is the single point that represents the function's maximum or minimum, which implies that a point to either side of it (no matter how close) would not be a maximum or minimum. This means it would be less than or greater than that point, which suggests the vertex point is still part (actually the last point) of a (strictly) increasing/decreasing range  of values, but MathIsFun does not include the vertex, while the text does. Can someone explain why this descrepancy exists, and while doing that explain how this is actually supposed to be handled? I feel that the point should be included in the interval notation expressing the range of the one-to-one restrictions of quadratic functions. And how is the final exam going to treat these?",5252,984,1363466880

1451765,"Daniel, welcome, you sound adventurous! You will likely have a hard time covering everything you need to cover to be proficient enough to get a A+ grade on the final exam, unless you have already had a lot of algebra in HS or college, and you go flat out, full time on this material from this point until the exam. If I were you, I would just do all that I could, so I would learn whatever I could, then retake the course at another time, or consider this a preparation for college. But, I don't know what level you are at.

Each week has a list of videos and quizzes and further homework assignments they recommend to become proficient. The discussion forums can be utilized by a late comer if you search for things you want to know. That's one big advantage of starting late.

In the beginning, students had a hard time entering answers for quizzes, due to a cheesy user interface. The people at UC Irvine have been making steady progress and a lot of headway in phrasing their questions in ways that don't tax the front end too much, so those kinds of problems are now rare. However, there are still a couple of warning for you:  When entering an expression, be sure to place an asterisk between a number and a variable symbol (i.e. for 4x you enter it 4*x), Actually, anytime there is an implied multiplication, be sure to use asterisks. Also, group parts of expressions with parentheses whenever something might not be clear. At this point, the answers are easy to enter, but I am not certain the early quizzes will not have problems. If you encounter that kind of problem, I suggest you not spend much time trying to figure it out, cause you can waste a lot of valuable time. Also, along this line of thought, there is plenty of good advice in the fora that you can seek out.

If you decide to stay, I offer you the best of luck. There are people from over 50 countries taking this course.    - Bill",5290,993,1363550793

In this course, we get the vertex by using the general function ax^2+bx+c and completing the square to turn it into the vertex form. I have also been told that it is possible to find the vertex by using this formula:

-b/2a  (where b and a are gotten from the general form)

2461522,"Elmar, very good so far, that all sounds correct.  And yes, that is correct, you need to find the $$a$$.  If I am understanding you correctly then right now, your function is $$f(x) = -\sqrt{x +1} -1$$.  As you point out, it has the correct $$x$$ values, but the $$y$$ values do not correspond.  Let me call the final function we want $$g(x)$$ (the second graph in the problem) so it makes more sense.  So we are trying to find the $$a$$ value that makes this equation true : $$a \cdot f(x) = g(x)$$.  All we can do from here is plug in a couple $$x$$ values to try and find what $$a$$ should be.  

If $$x = 0$$ we see that $$g(0) = -4$$ and we want this to be $$a \cdot f(0) = a \cdot -\sqrt{0 + 1} -1 = -a -1$$

And if $$x = 3$$  we see that $$g(3) = -7$$ and we want this to be $$a \cdot f(3) = a \cdot -\sqrt{3 + 1} -1 = -2a -1$$

475385,"Start with a general equation of a quadratic equal to zero: ax^2+bx+c = 0

Divide both sides by a: x^2+(b/a)x+c/a = 0

Now subtract both sides by c/a: x^2+(b/a)x = -c/a

The coefficient on x can be rewritten as 2(b/2a). In the square of a binomial the coefficient on x is twice the numeric term. For example, (x+1)^2 = x^2-2x+1.. So to complete the square on the lefft side we add (b/2a)^2 or b^2/4a^2 to  both sides.

x^2+2(b/2a)x+(b/2a)^2 =  (b/2a)^2-c/a

Now the equation can be rewritten as (x+b/2a)^2 = (b/2a)^2-c/a  Taking either the positive or negative square roots will give you the value of x+b/2a and x is found by subtracting b/2a from both sides of the equations for the two possible solutions for the original equation.

Looks like you're running into an order of operations issue...meaning -x/x is being evaluated first (-1), then -2-1-1 ... and that = 4.  And no that's not the correct answer.   

The way around this is to make sure you're putting () around both the expressions in numerator and denominator.  In order of operations, () are always evaluated first.  Think of the pneumotic device PEMDAS  ( Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally --- Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication / Division, Addition/Subtraction).  This is the correct evaluation of order of operations.  I put M and D together and A and S together because they are on same level of priority, evaluated from left to right.

1451765,"Klaus is right that $$\sqrt{25}=\pm5$$ is always true. We know that all positive real numbers have two square roots, and $$\sqrt{0}=0$$. And, if the real number under the radical is negative, we find that our roots are complex. Klaus also said something that I now consider quite important, now that I have learned about functions. The square root function $$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$ is defined (in our text, p. 189) to have $$dom(f)=[0,\infty), ran(f)=[0,\infty)$$, and this (as Klaus already said) is a restriction on the domain of what would otherwise be the square root 'function' (which isn't a function because it produces twin outputs).

My purpose in bringing this up is the confusion that was experienced by a number of students, including myself, over when to use the PRINCIPAL square root (for the square root function it is the positive root), and when to remember that the context is not a 'function' that is under discussion. We ran into this at least twice. Once was the quadratic formula, another time was when we solved for x by taking the square root of both sides of an equation when one side was $$x^2$$. In this second case we were taught to leave $$x$$ on one side of the equal sign, and $$\pm$$ some expression on the other.

The way the square root is introduced in the text, and not only this text, is as $$\sqrt{a}=\pm b$$ is always true when a and b are positive real numbers. But the trouble is, these texts immediately move into a definition of the 'principal' root, without giving any explanation, leaving the student a bit hanging. This is speculation on my part, but I think Klaus's comments also support the idea, I feel the reason mathematitians introduced the 'principal' root notion is basically because they love functions, and without the restriction on the range of the square root function (which is the effect of choosing the principal root) working with square roots would be unfunction-like, and therefore messy. Can anyone confirm this?

2523785,"I want to take this opportunity to thank you Drs. Eichorn and Lehman, from the bottom of my heart for doing this class! I'm a 56 year old disabled RN and I decided that since I have time, and these free courses are available, I would try some of them, (the last time I was in college was in the 70's). I have a huge interest in astronomy, cosmology, and particle physics, but all those courses require a basic understanding of calculus, which unfortunately, I don't have.

 I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little girl, but when I told my mother, she said,""Only boys grow up to be astronauts, and besides, you have to be really good at math to do that.""  Well, I didn't let the only boys thing scare me, but I DID let the math thing scare me! Back in the 60's and 70's, girls were not encouraged to do such things as higher math. We didn't have to take trigonometry or calculus, although most of the boys did. 

I always kind of felt like there was this big secret about all this complex math that made it too hard for me to comprehend. I tried a calculus course my second year at Penn State, but the professor was Korean and spoke with a very thick accent. It took me a week before I could understand he was saying ""straight line"" instead of ""street light"". So I dropped the course and believed the lie that I wasn't good at math. Anyway, as I said, all the classes I wanted to take required calculus, but I didn't want to dive right into calculus until I did some review of my VERY rusty algebra.
  
I wasn't sure I could do it, but I want to say, I have completely enjoyed taking this whole course! It was very tough for me at first because it had been 39 years since I was in high school, and taken any kind of math class, and I sure have forgotten a lot. But the discussion forum was great, and helped a lot. I didn't hurt that the lessons were very well explained, and the quiz problems really taught me how to do the math, not just eliminate options, (although I do admit that half the battle at first was putting in the answers). I am just amazed at how really GOOD at math I turned out to be! I totally GET IT! You have no idea how incredible this feeling is! I feel like I can do anything now, and the next thing I plan to do is take the pre-calculus course you two offer! After that who knows, maybe I'll design the first warp drive starship engine! Besides... I don't know what I would do without hearing Dr Lehman's soothing voice every day...hahaha!

The correct answer is $$g(x)=2x^4$$. 

What you're talking about is  $$g(x)=-2x^4$$, right? 

No that will not work actually. Consider a simple case. $$|x+1|\neq|-x+1|$$, the absolute values work only after you evaluate the terms inside, before that, the negative signs do make an effect.


Unless you're talking about $$g(x)=|2x^4|$$, but you do realize that as long as $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$,  $$2x^4$$ is always positive, thus $$2x^4=|2x^4|$$.

There are complex proofs out there, but one illustration of why it works can be found at:  http://www.mathwords.com/c/conjugate_pair_thm.htm.

3.  multiply both sides by reciprocal of denominator, 
4.  left side should have two factors ()*(), right side will have denominator cancel out
5.  multiply factors on left side, use distributive property, right side stays the same for now
6.  get all y's on the right side, number on left hand side
7.  on right side factor out y

Or you can think of it as 5 intervals
What is the sign of -x-5 when x &lt; 5
what is the sign when x lies between -5 and -1
what is the sign of -x-5 when x likes between -1 and 3

Determine if you want to include the points when you get through the test point.
These are going to be same intervals that you will need to the entire problem.
I like to draw a number line for each quantity.  Then draw a number line for the solution.  that will help you see what intervals you want for the entire problem to be less than or - to zero.

All you have to do is getting a total score of (I think) 60%, which means getting 80% in the final test should eliminate any missing answers in the quizzes.<br /><br />Actually you can calculate your total score needed for getting this certificate in the final exam. Count the total points possible in the 9 weeks, multiply them by 5. Then multiply by 60%. This is your total score needed for getting the certificate. You know how many points you've already made. Subtract them, and the rest is the points needed in the final exam.<br /><br />Finally: Why give up? If you don't get the certificate, then you still have learned a lot and is better prepared for any retakes of the course.

I think there definitely should have been a midterm and then maybe another one instead of one huge final. If you aren't going to put a time limit on the quizzes, then why would you do so for the final exam? You can't just switch up the game on the last day and call it good. It isn't fair to those who are really trying to understand the concepts. Some people, like myself, need more time to figure out the right answer. And yes, you get better with lots of practice, but there seemed to be too much piled into this course with not enough time to break down each concept. So a do better for next time, either time ALL of the quizzes, or don't time the final. OR, have two midterms that are both timed... something to that effect would be fair to students. NOT happy with how this turned out.

Final exam should be a little bit more difficult than the rest of it. Only then you can see your progress and how do you react going a little bit futher from your comfort zone. This is only one possible path to perfection.<br /><br />And I am again really sorry for those who think that system is wrong.

But on the other hand to test that you've absorbed some new body of knowledge, it's possibly best that the time pressure is a little bit less.

<p><span>I am taking the class without credit and really enjoyed it.&nbsp; The format was REALLY easy to understand. &nbsp;However, I think that the timed final exam
defeats the purpose of taking the class without credit.&nbsp; I am finding myself more worried about the
time than on the process of learning.</span></p><p><span></span><span>I have a master degree and want to continue for my PhD. Since
my bachelor was in Arts, I do not have the math prerequisites required for the
PhD I want to pursue.&nbsp; I am planning to
take calculus this next semester.&nbsp; Hence
I saw on this course an excellent opportunity to review algebra on my own pace
without the hassle of a class for credit.&nbsp;
</span></p><p><span></span><span>If there is no proctor overlooking the students own work, there
is no point to time the test but to assess the student capability of working under
pressure.&nbsp; If I could obtain credit for
the class later on, I would understand the purpose of timing the exam.&nbsp; However, if this is not a possibility, there
is no value-added on timing it.</span></p><p><span></span>I will finish the exam on my own pace and hope you post the

Those to which this happened to, including myself, were put at a huge disadvantage as far as being able to review answers and study problem areas. Partial attempts should be reversed due to this lack of clarification. This would not give those that had a connectivity issue an unfair advantage as any partial attempt that was a result of disconnection was simply a partial attempt. Those that had a partial attempt missed the opportunity to work out every problem type first and identify weaknesses before another attempt. Everyone should have the opportunity to solve each problem type at least once before taking the final exam, and if there were extenuating circumstances that prevented them from doing so, exceptions should be made.

Is there really a need for such a hard deadline in such close proximity to the final homework?&nbsp; I feel like the main purpose of online education is to give people with few resources the opportunity to get an education as well as credit for it -- these people tend to also be very busy and tired from their hard daily work.

1052701,"Thank you to the Professors and Coursera for this course. Never thought I would say this but I enjoyed Algebra this time around (not in high school and University). I believe this should be the standard on how to teach the course. Most explanations are very clear and easy to understand (except that Composition of functions, Part 3). Those topics/quizzes that needed more clarification, the people at the discussion forums were kind enough to help and explain further. Thank you to them as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also believe that being anonymous or unknown to one another unexpectedly help a lot as well.&nbsp; Unlike being in an actual school room where people see one another, there is no fear/stigma of asking for help if you don't understand something lest you be labeled slow or a pest. Therein lies the secret to better understanding of the course, asking for help without fear.<br /><br />A certificate would have been icing on the cake, but the time conditions are too rigid for ordinary joes and janes like me to pass the test in Math courses. Speed in math is not my strongest point. There are too many topics to review and crammed at once in one sitting. Doing the quizzes alone took me an hour sometimes but I mostly get it done and that to me is satisfying enough. Now I know for sure that I can handle higher Math. Somehow, I think the course being accredited to some schools had an effect on how the exam was laid out. It is my personal opinion that If the purpose is to educate and make algebra not daunting, they have succeeded with flying colors. But if the objective was for most students to pass the final exam, the exam method leaves much to be desired. I'll probably take Pre Calculus but probably will fail the final exam if the time limit/rules don't change. I am satisfied to be able to impart the knowledge gained to my children and they don't have to fear Math like I did back then. Some suggestions to the organizers:<br />1. Pls. fix the input issue. Would relieve a lot of the frustrations.<br />2. A downloadable Powerpoint slide of the lectures would be nice.

<p>Thank you for your time and effort that you put into this
course. Coursera is an excellent learning opportunity both for us students who
get an opportunity to learn without monetary cost. The universities and
professors who run the classes get to better understand how to teach in a mooc
environment. This is my second coursera class that I followed closely,
participated in all assignments and exams. While I enjoyed learning algebra and
did well on the exam, the class fell short in some respects.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a significant lack of resources offered in the
class; video tutorials are not lectures; links to websites with exercises is
not homework; forums where the professors rarely respond to inquiries is
disheartening. Math is learned by practice. The context of the ""why"" of equations needs more time than a tutorial offers. These are important factors that were missing in this course.</p>

<p>I successfully completed this course because I paid the
money for an aleks account, found a copy of the Barnett precal book recommended
by aleks, and have an affinity for math. I am grateful to you all for &nbsp;offering
me the format to start learning algebra. I intend to continue learning more
algebra and hopefully calculus.</p>

<p>The video tutorials we clear and concise. I am
grateful to have them downloaded as a resource for the future. The course moved at a good pace. I learnt a good deal in these 10 weeks.</p>

<p>The challenge of education in a mooc environment is the
shear numbers can be overwhelming. As a student, moocs can be daunting and I
can’t imagine being a professor in this situation. I am grateful to professors Eichhorn
and Lehman for putting yourselves out there. Thank-you for bringing mathematics
back into my life. I hope this class was a useful learning opportunity for you
both.</p>

<p>I wish you all (professors, staff and fellow students) the
best in your future endeavors.</p>

this course will probably figure to offer either a, (timed to complete

few years ago, if you were to walk up to me and tell me that I could
get a college course taught to me by a doctor of mathematics at nominal expenditure of cost, I would
have told you to get your head checked, as you were probably
crazy.<br /><br />I am very grateful for this course; but maybe like a
few other students can only get here to place x amount of time into
getting things done. My second wish would be that maybe the other
courses offered at Coursera, since this is an internet taught virtual course by nature,
would also adopt the expanded time principle to their lectures and
natures of encompassments of courses offered additionally?<br /><br />Again'
thank you very much for this course. This is not an opportunity that
drops out of the tree everyday into a person's lap at such a great

effort expenditure for this course involving the time and effort for
the student to complete the course, averages around two thousand
dollars worth of invested effort. This is time, aggravation of having
to use one's brain, along with materials if you are a copious note
taker such as myself. Great course, but like evolution parameters of
the course will also probably adapt to the student's time
constraints.<br /><br />Thanks, Dan

Although your factorization  as mentioned above is correct, we cannot go down this route in my opinion. We need to find the common factor of the denominator 100-4u^2 which is 4<em>(25-u^2) and then further factorise to 4</em>(5-u) (5+u) as the bracket is the difference of two squares. We now have (u-5) (u-3)/4<em>(5-u) (5+u). So now we have the denominator they were looking for in the form A/4</em>(5+u)</p>
<p>We now need to make one factor of the denominator = to a factor in the numerator. To do this we add a minus sign to the numerator and switch one of the factors of the denominator.</p>
<p>-(u-5) (u-3)/4<em>(u-5) (5+u) and now we can cancel the (u-5) from numerator and denominator and we are left with -(u-3)/4</em>(5+u)</p>
<p>In my opinion the answer is: A = -(u-3) or 3-u</p>

2288142,"Dear Doctors Eichorn and Lehman, I would like to thank you for an excellent overview of the concepts needed for university mathematics.I felt that the restrictions placed on the final helped make it a fair&nbsp;measurement of&nbsp;attainment. I have noticed many complaints about the fact that the final was timed and the anxiety that this caused. In my view, that anxiety is an issue that deserves separate treatment since all of life will present circumstances in which our fears cloud our thinking. Several tactics useful in the exam situation include humorously reminding oneself that flight is pointless (For example, ""There are no tigers here so this adrenaline is not needed."") I am told that stage actors will sit on their downturned hands for a few minutes before going onstage. They push against the seat of the chair for 5 or so seconds. This seems to turn off the adrenaline flow. In the end however, one needs to recognize that while marks are meaningful in some contexts, the true student values the knowledge gained and not the mark. In my case, I was delighted to learn to better check my work and how to better deal with absolute values. Sadly, I must continue to work on defining domaines. But this means I may wish to take this course again. Certainly, I enjoyed the intellectual challenge of something a little more interesting than Sudoku.",6260,1210,1365945805

2710019,"I completely agree with the original poster.&nbsp;<br /><br />I signed up late, and this was naive of me, but I believed that because Coursera was willing to let me sign up, they'd make provisions for me to complete the program later. And as absurd as it may sound, I could never find a place to email to ask if I could finish at my own pace--because I started weeks and weeks after the course started. And of course, now it's over. I don't know how long the video lectures will stay up, or if I can still take the exams. I don't need credit--I needed the knowledge from this class.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's infuriating to be sent to a support forum that is a series of FAQs or to be directed to a forum for general help. I can't believe there is no contact available to reach the professors, that there is no email where a person can ask for basic help with Coursera itself. That alone makes me&nbsp;believe&nbsp;that Coursera is not a good option for remote learning, and next time, I'll look elsewhere.<br /><br />The videos were helpful, but without assigned, graded homework, it was very hard to get the practice required to develop any facility with the material.

I found it frustrating with regards to the quiz feedback. The instructions were to get help from your fellow students in th forums. I did not find this very helpful. I was hopeful we could get the correct answers to the quizzes sooner than we did (only at the very end). Thus I was not able work backwards and find what I didn&#39;t understand or find where I was making careless mistakes. I live in Thailand. With the time difference and my inability to make Scrbblar work, I had some problems communicating with the staff. I had a huge technical problem with my second attempt on the final exam. 15 minutes to the end of the exam, I noticed that all my answers had disappeared. There wasn&#39;t enough time to find and re-enter my answers. I might not have passed the final, but that glitch guaranteed it. I know better how to take a math course in the future. My biggest complaint is the poor communication with the staff.</p>
