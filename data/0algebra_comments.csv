321026,"I am homeschoolng my 12 year old son and we have used all sorts of paid and free math programs.  From my point of view, here is the big difference in terms of learning (at least for a kid).  My son loves Khan - the videos are excellent, and you receive points and badges for working your way through the system, but the answers are multiple choice and he is one to guess rather than work.  Sure, there is always a choice for none of the above, so the assumption is that you actually tried to work out the problem on your own, you won't necessarily learn.  (Of course, this course is for adult learners, so most won't be tempted by the shortcuts.)  Thinkwell works the same way.  Short entertaining lectures by dynamic professors followed by multiple choice practice problems that allow multiple resubmissions followed by more difficult exams (or maybe they are not more difficult if you had actually done the work required for the practice problems rather than quickly trying to solve them in your head and/or using educated guesses).

Aleks requires you to enter the full answers.  The only hints are the boxes they use to offer you a choice of formats for fractions, exponents, etc.  On its own, Aleks is very dry.  The explanations are all typed without visual interest.  Aleks offers assessments and reassessments so that the student has all the necessary background and moves through the course methodically.  It also offers the student a choice of what to work on next, and gives positive feedback by filling the pie (good motivator for kids - I know this course isn't meant for kids, but I""m doing it, too, in order to refresh my algebra skills in order to help my son while he works in the course, and I'm motivated to take on new problems in order to fill my slice of ""pie."").  Another positive for us (and viewed as a negative from some others), is that Aleks allows you to move forward after getting only 3 problems of a certain type correct.  Khan requires closer to 10 tries.  Less repetition once you have mastered the topic is good.

I find using Aleks for this course much better than using Aleks in general.  The UCI videos are very good thanks to the use of color, step by step clear explanations, and showing what full written answers should look like.  Like the written explanations in Aleks, the videos that come with the book that are accessible online are horridly boring.  Another benefit of Aleks - if the software tests you beyond a certain problem type, there is no need to watch the related video, so it's a time saver as well.  The videos are excellent however, and I'd like to see my son watch all of them, but it's a question of time.

So no, you don't have to spend money to take this course, but if you do choose to, we have found Aleks very helpful.   (FYI, Aleks also includes access to a pdf version of the Barnett Precalculus book on a chapter by chapter basis).  

Dr. Eichhorn, thank you for offering a full math course on Coursera.  For us, it is the perfect solution to my hunt for a graded math class for my son, particularly since he is ahead and behind at the same time (did not finish his Art of Problem Solving math course last year, but had to learn part of algebra 2 for AP chemsitry this year).  Using Aleks, we can fill in the gaps and move forward at the same time.  He would not have tolerated an entire algebra course on Aleks, but the videos make a difference.  (We signed up for precalculus as well, with the hope that it will remain available after the live class ends and he can move through that on Aleks as well.)  Please also say thank you to Dr. Lehman.  Her video explanations are excellent.  I usually don't recommend Aleks, but using Aleks through this online class works perfectly.  Thank you!

Then just like the example in the video, just concentrate on simplifying the thing on the left until you've got rid of all the negative exponents - exactly like the second video example, which shows something very similar.

What do you mean when you say you ""grouped like variables together, inverted the fractions with negative exponents to get rid of the negatives""?  I think you are probably complicating things by trying to invert the fractions prematurely.

Once you have grouped like variables, then use the Properties of Integer Exponents (video #4) to either add or subtract the variable exponents as needed.  Rewatch the video I mentioned above and look at rule #5 (the quotient rule) on the first slide (i.e.:   a^m / a^n = a^m-n).  So in other words, after grouping like variables, DO NOT try to invert the fractions and go from there, you will just create a headache for yourself.  Instead, (after you have grouped like variables) SUBTRACT the power of the variable in the denominator from the power of the variable in the numerator THEN if you still have a negative power, invert the fraction at that point.",356,24,1359499488

Here's how I looked at the question to make it sink in, hopefully it might help others still struggling:
Each question has the same two equations, but ultimately they are all the same problem. Essentially, you need to make the left hand equation (the one without k) look the same in format as the right (the one with k), and then the actual values being asked drop into full view. Just work on simplifying the left hand side until you only have positive exponents as per the tutorial video.",779,71,1359499588
329648,"Hi,

Overall what you need to do is simplify the equation on the right and then provide number answers for the exponents of the variables the quiz asks about from the equation on the left.

So you are given this equation on the left:
(4 *x^−3 *y^5 * z^−2 / ( 6*y^−5 * z^5 * x^−8 ))

And this equation on the right (or something similar to this I can't remember it exactly):
k(z^r / x^s * y^t)

So after you simplify the equation on the left, it will be in the same form as the equation on the right, where k is the coefficient (number).  So at that point you need to then put in the number you got for the coefficient as k and the put in the exponents of your simplified variables in the other questions.  I hope this helps.  Let me know if this is unclear or you need more help.",375,24,1359500107

I did worked for internet company (web agency) for long time. Companies work for people, with people, who very often does not understand how system works, and they can not explain exactly what is the problem. I had the kind of reaction you had for long time, discovering every time I did not understand the problem they was experiencing. But I repeat this misunderstod over and over again, for years.

What I learned is that I am not so good on listening to what damn they are saying. It was not on a problem of the system that I had to work on, it was me. I just can not give customers an answer that solve their problem and I obfuscate it with my orrogance, and always thinking they are silly.

So I never develop knowledge on listening science. Most of the problem I was trying to solve when I design a system actually did never exists, because I fail to understand what people know and what not, what do they understand without pain, and what is hard. How to satisfy them.

And most of all I was feeding my arrogance, not their need. People who ask me for a work tends to pay me the least, it was known to them I want to give something, but every customer feels unconfortable with that kind of reaction.

Now, I open the page https://class.coursera.org/algebra-001/lecture/index
I click on https://class.coursera.org/algebra-001/lecture/219
It open a page in a iframe, I look at code, I find this link
http://d19vezwu8eufl6.cloudfront.net/algebra/recoded_videos%2FCoursera%20Intro%20Video%20%5B0d79ca85%5D%20.mp4

I download it with wget and play and watch with vlc.

Oh, fine. But that is not the way it is supposed to work, am I wrong? (let me be ironic, just for fun now;)

No way (or userfriendly way) to switch to flash player mode.

I could share my desktop if you are courious to look at it when I am experiencing the problem.

I don't have a 9 year old here....looking over my shoulder....THANK GOD!  

If it makes you feel any better (pathetic attempt) I too am finding parts  this course frustrating - cough- CHALLENGING.  Here are some examples.

1) Showing how to solve a problem on the lecture where the fraction was made into a whole number and then using fractions that cannot be made into whole numbers on the quiz - so that I pop a vessel trying to figure out how to do something DIFFERENT.

2) Using terms like 'foiling' in a lecture as if I already understand foiling  - which then puts me in ""what the heck is she talking about and where the heck did she get those numbers"" mode.  

3.  I am now working on rationalizing a denominator and once again....the example on the lecture is different from the actual quiz which includes whole numbers!  So once again, I""m struggling through this section, searching for anything and everything online that might help me understand.

I do have to say though, that I have contacted Dr. Lehman and she was kind enough to take the time to respond (although I had already figured out the problem when I heard back).

Over the past 48 hours or so, this thread has but a few posts made by a handful of students out of -potentially - thousands. It indicates very little to me. 

Yes, students appreciate the site; I never doubted that so comments here from appreciative students are not surprising. I DO doubt that some of our peers are inclined to change their negative attitude toward this course (or anything they have a negative perception of). Some people are stubborn and closed-minded. Some people are proud of their resistance to change. Some people who read the OP may never seriously consider its message. To those few, enrolling may be thought of as a waste of time and to them Coursera is just junk. Some of them have probably already unenrolled in frustration. It's unfortunate.

Awesome!  I think I wanted to be a scientist for much of my childhood. I dug up my old Scholastic Book Club's ""The Mad Scientist Club"" to try it out on my little boy after we finish our current nightime book.

I took a fantastically fun class, Astronautics, in High School (St. Francis Prep, Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY) where we even ran a Space Shuttle simu-launch/mission back in 82/83 ... on *networked* VIC-20s, hah.  Great times, I was TDRSS? supervisor.

I unfortunately met my match with Calculus. A combination of having problems with it even when took Calc I/II in HS then made worse in College with Calc II (I was tested...grrr... and placed in that...sigh), then dropped to Calc I, 3 weeks in, then withdrew. Then tried Calc I, withdrew, then again...incomplete. I blame the flightiness of teenage years, working ""part time"" 30 hours a week either before, after or before AND after classes, incorrect (all too common probably) choices between seeing girlfriend on her day off from classes vs driving 30 miles to class. OK... and probably the undiagnosed ADD (not the AD&D from TSR, I did that one too) for several decades.


I am a Senior Software Engineer. I develop primarily using C++. I started back a few years ago as I can at a local Community College (I also recommend the series, it's great ;P) to go back and get an AS on the way to BS finally (CSC Major, of course.) 

However, I changed jobs from Valhalla to being back in Manhattan so, going in person is out of the question again and have lingered threatening to repeat the past. This is because, even though I am 5 classes from completing it, 2 of those are Calc I and II (don't get me started on a discussion of WHY is Calc required for CSC instead of a choice of domain-related classes). I will probably go Physics I/II for the science and the only other class is a (I hope) much easier for me Discrete Math (seems to be logic/boolean focused.)

I can't go to WCC now and I am too fearful to take Calc online (they don't offer Discrete online and Phys I'd want to take at least Calc I and have to there for at least Lab once a week... with my hours, not likely) without ANY ""school"" math in so long, not to mention (although, I did...in detail) failing miserably in my yute. However, my realization of the importance of things has matured as I aged and I actually DO all my assignments now...with attention to learning even! I currently have a 4.0 for all the classes I have taken for the AS (even non-CSC!) but I am still a-feared of Calculus, but I shall persevere...

I will do my bleepest to grok this thing this time around. Even though I have to relearn the older Math I >was< good at once...

Oh... and back to my earlier rant... the ONLY time I had to ""employ"" Calculus-like Math in my career  was when I was at Goldman... I had an NYU professor feeding me formulae and algorithms for some predictive analytics. Not because I didn't have a College Degree; rather because that's what they did all the time on this project. I expect they, wisely, decided it was best to not have the Programmer Mathmatificate (technical term, look it u...err...nm...) nor the Erudite Mathmetician attempt to code enterprise back-end apps.

Yes, I'd prefer it if our peers were above such behavior, instead seeing the full value of Coursera and not causing purely self-induced suffering to the degree seen in the forums.

This angry peer situations does invoke sadness as all of the unpleasant, conditioned reactions are avoidable.

I have long known that people dislike math mostly because, in general, their elementary school teachers didn't like it, were typically afraid of failing it when they were in school, and the textbook writers have made it impossible for a student to see the forest for the trees. No person can read and perform all that is in one of those tomes, no matter how many semesters are devoted to it. Despite that, I have come to know math as both essential AND fun, when you see it in its proper perspective, learn well each piece you study, and persevere. ALEKS will guide you so you truly learn this level of Algebra. You will be surprised, after spending many hours in ALEKS, that the videos and examples of the main COURSERA website will be very clear to you. And, finally, it doesn't matter what your grade turns out to be. That is the most important thing I can tell you.

In the case of a negative you are moving the decimal right which is a smaller and smaller number.

Example -0.0099 is  is -9.9*10^-3 and 9,900.00 is 9.9*10^3.  Hope this helps.

If you trade off the price of the book with the price of ALEKS, and then don't buy the book, you net out pretty even,  Of course, if you can't afford the price, you can do the course without it, but probably it will take longer and you will be missing topics.

The quizzes are nicely related to the content and the order seems to be fine too, you can use the previous topics to help solving problems in the later topics.

One tip is to always make sure you put * (an asterisk - for times) in between anything that multiplies i.e. 3a would be 3*a, or 4*root(89,4) would mean 4 times the fourth root of 89.

 - 3x needs to be split (you can check the video lecture for ""ac"" method, or you can try guessing)

 - We get x^2 + 4x - x - 4
 - Take out common factors. x(x+4) - (x+4) -- for the **- x - 4** part, I only ""took out"" the negative sign, so the numbers following it will change their sign.

1827609,"I'll try to give you a run-down of how this problem works. I haven't tried to give technical details on an answer before so I apologize if it's incomprehensible ;)

First thing you want to do is factor the denominators to find your LCD. The LCD is: (2x+5)(x+1)(x+2)

You then multiply the first fraction by what the denominator is missing, over itself. After this step your first numerator should look like 9(x+2). Then multiply the second fraction (including the - sign) by the factor its denominator is missing. In this case your second numerator should look like -3(x+1). 

So now you have 9(x+2)-3(x+1) divided by (2x+5)(x+2)(x+1). 

finish your equation in the numerator, and it should look like this: 9x+18-3x-3

Taking it one more step: 6x+15

That's it! The finished formula below is accepted as the right answer:

I have just finished sampling from a variety of math texts I personally own, plus looking at Wikipedia (their discussion on Natural Numbers is helpful) and discovered that there is no universal consensus among mathematicians over whether or not to include zero in the natural numbers. I found discrepancies among my set of texts, most did not include zero, but others did, including one I know to respect, because it is written by Roger Penrose, one of our best mathematicians. Here is what he had to say, and he supports Diogo's initial claim.

“The natural numbers are the quantities that we now denote by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,  etc., i.e., they are the non-negative whole numbers. (The modern procedure is to include 0 in this list, which is an appropriate thing to do from the mathematical point of view, although the ancient Greeks appear not to have recognized ‘zero’ as an actual number. This had to wait for the Hindu mathematicians of India, starting with Brahmagupta in the 7th century, and followed up by Mahavira and Bhaskara in the 9th and 12th century, respectively.) The role of the natural numbers is clear and unambiguous. They are indeed the most elementary ‘counting numbers’, which have a basic role in whatever the laws of geometry or physics might be. (The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, by Roger Penrose, © 2004 Vintage Books, a division of Random House, New York, p. 63). Presumably, people were 'counting' things long before there was an acceptance of the number zero, and I was referring to that set of numbers as the counting numbers, since reidentified as the natural numbers, along with the addition of zero.

1451765,"This might help. From a book: Mathematics From the Birth of Numbers, by Jan Gullberg

""Starting with the natural numbers, or counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , we have numbers where addition and multiplication will always result in a natural number, but these numbers alone are not sufficient for subtraction. Supplementing with zero and negative whole numbers, thus obtaining the integers,  . . . -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ., we have enough numbers for addition, multiplication, and subtraction of any integers but not for division, which necessitates that we include numbers that are ratios of integers, e.g., 1/2, 2/3, 81/81. We now have integers and ratios of integers, which all are known as rational numbers.""

If that seems reasonable, then pick some small natural number, say 3. Suppose you have three sheep. If you loose one of your sheep, you subtract one from the three you had, and you now have two sheep. Mathematically, you have the equation 3-1=2. Now, if you add 1 to both sides of that equation, you get  (3-1)+1 = 2+1. Examine the left hand side of that equation, and instead of the association (3-1) being added to 1, let the association be  3+(-1+1). How are you going to understand (-1+1)?

Another way to see this is to assume you are working with the positive and negative whole numbers, let's call these numbers the 'integers without zero'.  Starting with the three sheep, keep subtracting 1, over and over, such as, 3-1=2, 2-1=1, 1-1=-1 (Which would have to be the case if you didn't have a zero integer to work with.) But that last equation, if you add 1 to both sides, says (1-1)+1=(-1)+1, which is the same as (1+1)-1=(+1)-1, or (+2)-1=(+1)-1, and we find that +2=+1, but we know +2≠+1. Something must be wrong, and it is the fact that we excluded zero from our set of integers.

Finally, you were told that 0 was a nothing number. Well, in the same book I found under ""The Etymology of English Number Names"" the following for ZERO. ""Zero derives from Hindu sunya -- meaning 'void,' 'emptiness,' -- via Arabic sifr, Latin cephirum, and Italian zevero,; sifr is also the origin of cipher."" The meaning given to ZERO can be the lack of some number of entitites, say the lack of any sheep. Most importantly, in order to perform mathematical operations, zero is essential, just as the negative whole numbers are, but they represent negative numbers of things, right? What does that mean? It only has meaning in the abstract world of mathematics? Well, it depends, because it could be used to represent debts versus wealth on a balance sheet, for example. You can even think of zero as a nothing number if you like, however, you must accept the fact that it is essential to mathematics.",2798,267,1360170834

An analysis teacher was a person who explains the series, the limits, ""las funciones"", ""convergencia"", an other things that I can't write in English because I don't know how to do it. They use the natural numbers to count, so they can't count anything with the 0.
To count something means you have things or a thing but if you have nothing, you can't count it, by this way the 0 haven't got a meaning.
However I think we need the 0!

Not unique questions; we all have the same.
For 1 and 4, you need to write just the coeffiecients and the constant so say you had 3a^2-2y+5, ABC would be 3 2 5. Leave a space in between each answer and mind your neg numbers!
2 and 3 have a different issue.  The program doesn't recognize that (x-2)(y-1) is the same as (y-1)(x-2) so if your answer is in the reverse order, u just need to keep on entering it!
Also, it won't work unless you follow the rules of adding the * between all the ones you have to multiply times each other, so (4*x-2)*(2*y+3).

Seth & Donna. It should be 4xy^2root((x^2y),3). That is the way I entered it, and I got full marks.

NOTE: The two statements look like they are the same, however they are different. Evidently, something happens between the entering of comments in this forum and the simple forwarding of them to the email list. Here something has deleted  all asterisks. That is why I came here. I was wondering if the staff had fixed the Q&A input, since to me you were saying that an expression had worked without asterisks, but sadly, it seems not to be true. However, if we treat this as evidence of something else being wrong, maybe a related problem, perhaps the staff might find it easier to troubleshoot the problem.

253842,"Excellent review Roger.  My experience is very similar to yours and I agree with your assessment on its strengths / weaknesses and summary.  My approach was a little different than yours, however.  I did not start the course relying on ALEKS to be my tutor.  I used all the Coursera course materials first then used ALEKS to augment my tutoring.  This may be due to the fact that I am VERY weak in this subject and cannot afford to miss out on any of the learning tools available.  I also had an email in ALEKS from Prof Lehman providing some guidance on use of the ALEKS tools to guide my learning process.  I think the UC staff will peak in periodically to see how you are progressing.  After successfully completing week 1 and 2 quizzes on coursera and my ALEKS learning progress, my first reassessment in ALEKS showed significant progress, and it reshaped my tutoring profile.  

I do believe my favorite tool out of ALEKS is explained in your 3rd paragraph under strengths.  These explanations are very very constructed and very helpful in complete understanding of their topics.  I print these out and then do my additional practice using these guides and am very pleased with my new understanding.  I am contemplating actually collecting some more of these explanations even on material I know something about for future reference. 
I am not using ALEKS so much as a tool for a better grade but more as a tutor to get me up to speed on a subject I was very weak in.

1451765,"Regarding your 'final note' about asterisks:

It looks like the output interpreter (what I am calling MathJax output jax) is expecting LaTeX coded math expressions, and it does well with your $$. . . $$ expressions. But when it gets to an asterisk it happens to find within a non-LaTeX math expression, in particular those that are not begun with a LaTeX signal $ or $$, it throws those asterisks away, and closes the space, so we end up with the expected )( rather than )*( that we input -- and it is indeed captured as )*( in the webpage source. So, when the output jax is processing the plain text, it knows it is in plain text, and thus isn't worried about an asterisk being in there, so it leaves them alone. The strange conversion of regular text to italicized text is probably due to a similar reason. For example, it normally happens to the second term of a three term expression, i.e. in (x+3)*(x+1)*(x-4), strangely, it happens only to the term (x+1), else it converts until the end of the sentence. That is to say, the italicizing begins after the output jax had just thrown away the first asterisk it didn't expect to see and closed its space. Something about that math expression recognition sensing procedure is FUBAR. But FOR SURE, when you type (x+1)*(x-1) from your browser and submit it to the coursera platform, that webpage captures the asterisk. The problem is not on input, it is on output.",3207,577,1360459189

You see, Carl, in my last comment, there was supposed to be an asterisk between ending and opening parentheses as in:

""expected )( rather than ) * ( that we input -- and it is indeed captured as ) *(  in the webpage source.""

I just used your observation to give myself the ability to express what is going on, namely separate the asterisk by spaces and things will be just fine. Well, the reason things seem fine, when they really aren't, is that the output jax interprets the space after the math expression and before the asterisk, as well as the space after, as being plain text subsequent to a math expression. That means it interprets those two binomials as two different math expressions! It doesn't interpret them as two binomials being multiplied.

Knowing this, can you better explain the student problem entry syntax, or is it irrelevant? Would it be better for students to enter their math expressions using LaTeX? Learning how to use LaTeX might be a challenge to some, but it might be worthwhile to them in the future?

I would suspect that without the soft deadlines the final deadline spike would be significantly greater and have the potential to create server problems with the volume of students enrolled in these courses. So your point about human beings not grading the work is not the only factor in the resources that students are consuming.
Another reason for soft deadlines is due to the interactive nature of the course. Since students engage each other on the message boards, meetups, scribblar, etc. It helps everyone if we all stay on the same track. If most of class is at week 4 and students start posting questions from week 1, it hinders the students that are following along with everyone else.

Personally, I know that anyone who seriously wants to learn any topic in mathematics needs to spend a lot of time listening, reading, working problems, thinking, working more problems, and more problems, then re-thinking  what they might have missed. It doesn't come easy, for most. In math, any primary topic left incompletely learned causes the rest to be fuzzy, and confusing. Math builds best on a solid foundation.. Those who succeed understand the fundamentals, and approach their study methodically, willing to put in the amount of time it takes,. They also come at their study with a joy of learning, rather than obsessing over what grade they might get. Math is indeed fun for those who care what they are feeding their brain. That said, I think it is all too easy to disparage this course as being just one among many 'better' Algebra courses.

Anyone who thinks that they are learning all they need to know to about Algebra just by watching the UC Irvine videos hasn't the slightest idea of what mathematics is. These professors are giving you a distilled set of the most important concepts, and they do it in a clear and understandable way. But you aren't going to learn Algebra just by watching those videos. You have to do the homework and probably a lot more if you really want to learn this subject. It is a lot of material to lean. So, don't blame the professors for your lack of initiative. The tests are harder than the videos suggest? Well, have you thought that those tests just might be alternate ways to teach you more concepts in Algebra? Think about it. They are not timed. You are permitted to take them as many as 100 times without penalty. You aren't satisfied unless you get a perfect 4.0 out of 4.0, right?

The best defense is to try to make a list of all things you learn about inputting your answers as you go, so you don't stumble on that problem ever again. Luckily, Week 3 quizzes reflect an intention on behalf of the teachers to minimize these difficulties (annoyances) by making required answers simple. The first answer on one of them was a single number, which isn't possibly a problem unless you have an wrong answer. And the second two questions required multiple choice answers, again impossible to make a mistake, unless a wrong answer. Just stick with it and things will get easier for you. ",3576,637,1360708294

1451765,"So, it's like the mixing of some percentage solution of alcohol (alcohol in water) with a different percent solution of alcohol to result in a final combined amount of a final percentage alcohol solution?

One thing is that with percentage you have to divide by 100. So, a 12% solution of alcohol has 12/100 (0.12) times the amount of solution worth of alcohol in that solution. Another thing is that the total amount of alcohol is conserved, meaning that the amount coming from one solution added to the amount coming from a second solution, added together must equal the amount of alcohol that will be in the resulting amount of percentage alcohol solution.

What you have to do first is understand the problem, so that means think about what is going on, and probably draw yourself a picture to see why it is physically real. . .  as if you were performing the described experiment. Then the next thing you have to do is look for what is being asked for you to answer. The third thing is to use a symbol to represent either that unknown answer, or something that can be related to it. I expect it to take two equations, maybe.

Is this helping? I am hesitant to say too much, because that takes away the learning experience when doing this yourself, and wouldn't be fair to other students. As I recall, this was very much like what was done in the video lecture, so go back and take another look at that video, then see how to change things accordingly. It really isn't much different. You can do it if you ignore your fear of math word problems and let your mind do the thinking it needs to do.

Hope I am being helpful..",3624,656,1360728786

What I did is made one equation: x + y = z   ===>   0.12x + 0.4y = 0.28z to keep same amount of alcohol.
y can be substituted by: y = z - x  obviously. So the final equation is: 0.12x + 0.4*(z - x) = 0.28z
From this point, solving it for z will give you  z= (some_number)*x  which is the amount of 28% solution. Then I substituted x with 300 and got the answer for z. Since I got both z and x, getting y was no longer a problem.

Another way to do the same thing is to write your equation #1 and then put equation #2 directly underneath, so you have two simultaneous equations that get solved for z. It has to be equivalent to solution by substitution. My point was that when you have two unknowns, you need two equations, which you did. Two things worthy of notice are 1) the two amounts of solution being added together  must equal the final amount of solution (conservation of solution volumes), and 2) the two amounts of alcohol being mixed together must equal the amount of alcohol in the final mixture (conservation of solute). The seesaw method, pointed out by Shanna Buchanan above, is yet another way to do the same thing, and might be easier. I'm still trying to understand why it works so easily.",3710,656,1360936767

I also re-read the course syllabus to find the ""course ... consist of a series of lecture videos, end-of video quizzes, readings and homework assignments"" --  my fault for paying more attention to ""series of lecture videos, end-of video quizzes"" and missing the ""readings and homework assignments"".  Although, in my defense, later in the syllabus it reads ""The final grade for this course will be based on weekly quizzes (20% of the final grade) and a final exam (80% of the final grade)"", which can lead a person to think that the lectures/quizzes and final are more important than the reading and exercises.

I guess my point should have been that the lecturer should have referenced that material in the lecture(s); for example ""...we now FOIL the expression -- FOIL is explained in {state reference material here} -- and we get..."" or ""...and we express this using interval notation -- see {state reference material here} for detailed explanation of the meaning of the notation symbols -- as an alternative to using a graph..."".

right-click ""open in new tab"" on ""http://stitz-zeager.com/Precalculus/Stitz_Zeager_Open_Source_Precalculus_files/SPreCalc07152011.pdf "" got me a blank white page

Read your post, opened the Adobe 9 program from the start menu; had to go through the whole registration [email, password [x2], first name, last name] thing Adobe requires to work with documents; had to open my email account to receive and complete the Adobe verification process; only to find there was no way to use the Adobe program to directly connect to the link.

Went back to the link, right-clicked and ""save target as..."" to documents [which took several minutes to download], went back to the Adobe ""acrobat.com My workspace"" window and used their very not-intuitive interface to finally find the downloaded document, and told it to open.

After another minute, I get a ""Acrobat.com could not access this PDF file, because it is corrupt."" message.

I'm balding; I don't HAVE any hair on my head to pull out. I spent more time trying to open this 'textbook', this ""Course Reading"", this ""READING ... ASSIGNMENT"" than I did watching the week 1 lectures AND doing the week 1 quizzes. If I wanted to be snarky, I'd say that the course syllabus should have listed hardware/software requirements and computer science prerequisites necessary for the course; but I'm merely venting my frustration, so I won't.

I'm going to walk away from this resource, think about it for a couple of days, and see if I can't come up with something.

Happy learning!

You  asked what does 3-(-2) equal, and she could have responded 5 as a comment and left you wondering. Instead, she wanted to give you a deeper insight into your question, hoping to help with any confusion. Precisely what you asked is ""What does subtracting the negative number (-2) from the positive number 3 equal?"" It equals 3+2=5, Using Shannon's logic, you can think of the double negatives (two minus signs in a row) in 3-(-2) as a single plus sign, and that 3-(-2) means 3+2. It is good that you asked your question because airing it has value to many people studying algebra.

Since the entire expression is raised to the -2 power, I would first reverse the numerator and denominator so the expression would become

[                             ] 2
[6y^(-5) z^5 x^(-8) ]
[------------------------]
[4x^(-3) y^5 z^(-2) ]

FForgeting the power of 2 for the time being, we combine like terms. This means for each variable we subtract the power of the variable in the denominator from the power of that variable in the numerator. For variable x, this means 

x^(-8)/x^(-3) = x^(-8-(-3)) =x^(-8+3) =x^(-5)

Do this with y and z as well. Since x has a negative exponent (-5), this is in effect division. So you can put x in the denominator and take away the minus sign in the power.

x^(-5) = 1/x^5

Once each veriables exponent has been found, you multiply the 6/4 by itself (that will be your k) and double the exponents of the variables. For example, (1/x^5)^2 = 1/x^10.

1451765,"Carl, starting at i^1 = i, ascending powers of i repeat this four element sequence { i, -1, -i, 1 }. That is to say, i^1 = i, then i^2 = -1, then i^3 = -i, then i^4 = 1, and as you continue increasing the powers of I, this sequence keeps repeating cyclically . In solving a given power of i problem we first examine the exponent of i to see whether it is odd or even. If it is odd, we break apart an i from the given power of i so we have an even power of i multiplied by i. Then we work on the even power of i. We divide that even exponent by 2 to see how many i^2 powers we have, and then replace the even power of i by an i^2 raised to that reduced. If that reduced power is even we just say it  is +1, and multiply the broken apart i by +1 to get i. If, however, the result of dividing the even i power by 2 ends up with an odd power for the i^2, we then break apart the odd power of i^2 so it has an even power of i^2s multiplied by the broken apart  i^2. Then we can do the same, i.e., the even power of i^2 equals +1 and we multiply that by the broken apart i^2 to get the answer that has to be multiplied by the broken apart i. All this fussing, ends up dealing correctly with the four step cyclic sequence that powers of i follow. I know it does, but I do not quite see HOW our procedure does that.

He agreed with me in that if you take his (very nice) graphic showing the four-step cycle and run it counter-clockwise, as if reversing multiplication by i, so that it becomes division by i at each step, you have in effect achieved the taking of roots at reciprocal powers. Also, he provides a simple way to see and do the kinds of i problems we are working. He show that you can use  i^4 = 1 (equivalent to i^2 x i^2 = (-1) x (-1) = 1) quite effectively. All you need to do to the next i power problem is take the power and divide it by 4. (of course after reducing it to an even power) and if it divides perfectly, the answer for that part is 1. If not, you can easily figure which of the other three places on the cycle you have landed, and you just use that { i -1 i 1 }. He showed the use of i^2 and you have to write out twice as many i^2 than i^4 in working with it by writing out the complete expansion.

Archaeologically Speaking: Since this course is basic Algebra, meaning the laws and properties involved in the manipulation of symbols in equations in which the variables and constants are defined to exist within the Real Number System, we are confined by its chronological development to talking about a kind of mathematical prehistory, i.e. mathematics as it existed just prior to the admission of complex numbers. In general, our theorems, definitions and discussions, all begin by restricting our domain of concern such that we stay within the real number system. It is a packaging issue today. In learning Algebra, we have defined away any possibility of (easily) entering the forbidden jungle of complex numbers, thereby making the beasts of that jungle mostly invisible to our inexperienced eyes. The trouble is, when the course first injected a whiff of those invisible, but real, things, our logical thinking machines began to rapidly become undone, the more so the more they were discussed, and that should have been expected, because Algebra self-enforces a rigid confinement, and no one has been willing to expend the energy it would take to rationalize the entire (lowest level) mathematical universe so as to treat complex numbers as an integral part yet make mathematical knowledge swallowable by students.

For example, this thread is asking why mathematicians arbitrarily selected the “PRINCIPAL” root as the general answer to square root problems. We have been told “it’s a little subtle, and can most definitely be confusing,” and, “It is true that any positive real number has two ‘square root’s"", and “we could have just as easily said that the negative root is the principal square root,” but “Obviously, we don't do that because that seems a little silly.” Respecting that those answers were correctly put, they nonetheless might have seemed to some, incomplete, at least to some subtle degree. It is never silly to question anomalies. I believe these problems are due to an historical accident in which we are left dealing with a subject forever preserved in amber.

Theorem 2 of Section R-2 (text) provides a table of the number of REAL nth roots of b (Let n be a natural number and let b be a real number), for b>0, b=0, b<0, and n-even or n-odd. The number of roots ranges from 0 to 2, with 1 being the number whenever n-odd. But for n-even and b<0, that theorem says 0 REAL roots, it doesn’t explain that the 0 might be hiding complex roots from our view. It is as simple as that, the theorem, as written, only admits that real numbers exist in our mathematical universe, a universe that only contains basic algebra. So, we are actually participating in a Santa Claus-like world, where our parents, who have long since stopped being amazed by the new and improved number system of their grown up world are hoping that by postponing the day of introduction they won’t do our learning development any serious harm. Or, better, that if they postpone, the good that might do us hopefully outdoes the bad. In the meantime, things can proceed along as usual. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

And so it was with the Video-Lecture that started this thread, Complex Numbers & Radicals. Wait, what did? But before spending valuable course time on properly introducing a whole new mathematical world view, they simply posited that “Now, we are going to be using the following property here.” PROPERTY: For any positive real number a, we have the following property:  sqrt(-a) = i*sqrt(a). Well, that property violates Theorem 4 in our real number system text (p. 17) which states: For n a natural number greater than 1, and x and y positive real numbers,. . .  2) The nth root of xy = nth root of x times the nth root of y. This ‘property,’ inserted willy-nilly into the video, says that if we want to take the square root of a negative 1 multiplied by a positive real number a, an algebraic manipulation that is clearly prohibited by Theorem 4 which required both multiplicands be positive, well, with using complex numbers we can get a reasonable answer, but don’t try to remember this point because it won’t do you any good, except in those rare cases where our discussion includes complex numbers, and actually could be confusing enough to mess you up when working a problem. The main truth is, it doesn’t work that way in basic algebra, but it is nonetheless coming at you and has somewhat become visible, leaving confusion in its wake.

Just note that Theorem 4 is written to intentionally keep us confined to the real numbers, and that was done with good reason, but that doesn’t say that we should remain in the dark as to what is going on around us, around our subject, that is. Some students have risen to the subtle intellectual challenge, and their questioning should hearten us all, but I suspect that many have not, and at least some of them remain in a semi-conscious state of unexplored confusion.

This special property suggests sqrt(-a) = sqrt((-1)*(a)) = sqrt(-1)*sqrt(a) =  i*sqrt(a), since i = sqrt(-1), as i^2 = -1, but this logic violates a theorem that says if both of the factors under a radical are positive real numbers, then you can break them apart into two separate radicals, otherwise you cannot. The lecture goes on to work the problem again, but ‘incorrectly,’ by illegally combining the radicands in the beginning step to get sqrt(-3)*sqrt(-12) = sqrt((-3)*(-12)) = sqrt(36) = 6 (the positive root), which is the negative of the (-6) answer initially calculated, but is taken as incorrect. Before starting the ‘incorrect’ solution, she specifically pointed out that she was intentionally violating the theorem I mentioned, by combining the two radicals when their radicands were not both positive. She wanted to demonstrate what happens when you do violate. The theorem forbids that no matter if you are taking a radical apart or putting two together. NOTE: In the example, the special property violates the same theorem she intentionally violated, as I showed above, so this should leave anyone a little confused. I am assuming that the special property applies only when the context is changed to complex algebra, or complex arithmetic, whatever it might be called, as it doesn’t apply when restricted to real numbers.",3990,734,1361513073

What I really don't like, is that there's no way to appeal the ""wrong answers"" from the quiz feedback page. I mean, in a brick and mortar school/class, when you get your quiz paper back, you can argue for your answer to the teacher after class; here [it seems] the only way to argue is to complain in a thread. So the thought that I can't appeal, or argue my reasoning, of answers on the final is depressing.

As for people dropping out of the course, GOD YES I sympathize. It's been almost 40 years since I took HS math, and calculus in college, (I'm doing this to refresh my memory and skills) but it is [...] frustrating.

The sqrt(-a) = sqrt ((-1)*a) = sqrt(-1) * sqrt(a) = i * sqrt(a). But that step where the two products inside the radical are broken apart into two radicals is forbidden by the theorem in our text, which says that for all x,y positive real, we have sqrt(xy) = sqrt(x) * sqrt(y), but it is not true if x or y is a negative factor. Does that make the special property false? I see that it is a DEFINITION in the text, and it is called the principal square root of a negative number, denoted by sqrt(-a), where ""a"" positive, is defined by sqrt(-a) = i * sqrt(a). It also says that the other square root  is -sqrt(a) = -i * sqrt(a).

2461522,"Bill, do you think you could list the numbers of Theorems and Definitions you are talking about? 

But I think the point is this.  First, we start out and we only know about square roots of positive numbers.  Because we know that for any real number $$x$$ $$x^2$$ is positive.  So we make a theorem saying that we can break apart $$\sqrt{xy}$$ to $$\sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}$$ if both numbers are positive (because we don't know how to handle negative square roots).

Then, later we find out it would be nice to have a way to handle negative square roots, because of the fact that we want a solution to the equation $$x^2 + 1 = 0$$.  But to do this, we must define a new number $$\img$$ and it creates a whole new system of numbers, called the complex numbers.  So in this new system, we find that we can split $$\sqrt{-x}$$ as $$\sqrt{x}\sqrt{-1} = \img \sqrt{x}$$ but only if $$x$$ is positive because otherwise we could deduce that $$x = -x$$ as shown in the text.  

So, I would say its important to note that by defining $$\img$$ we have actually introduced a whole new set of numbers.  And so these numbers follow new rules, even though in many cases they are similar to real numbers.",4511,825,1361851359

1451765,"I purchased a copy of the recommended course text ""Precalculus: Seventh Edition, by Barnett, Ziegler, Byleen, and Sobecki. The theorem I referred to is THEOREM 4: ""Properties of Radicals"" p.17, For n a natural number greater than 1, and x and y positive real numbers: 1)   2) nth root of xy  =  nth root of x times nth root of y.  3). . . Everything prior to that point in the text was about the real number system. Complex numbers are finally introduced on page 74, and the special property is found on page 80 as DEFINITION 4: Principal Square Root of a Negative Real Number, and it introduces both the positive and negative square roots of negative numbers. There are two other statements worth noting: 1) Just before Definition 4, ""If x is a negative real number, then x still has two square roots, but now these square roots are imaginary numbers,"" (My calculator complains NON-REAL ANSWER) and 2) On the very next page, p. 81, in a CAUTION: they warn to take care when presented with an expression 1 - sqrt(-9) to immediately convert it to 1 - i3 before proceeding. According to them :""This is a necessary step because some of the properties of radicals that are true for real numbers turn out not to be true for complex numbers. IN PARTICULAR:  For positive real numbers a and b, sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab)  BUT  sqrt(-a) * sqrt(-b) DOES NOT EQUAL sqrt((-a)*(-b)). To me, that is just restating THEOREM 4 in a complex number context, which only reinforced my feeling that Definition 4 has a flaw in it. In the course lecture on radicals in complex numbers, the first example was done in two ways, the second of which she intentionally broke THEOREM 4 in the first step, to show what happens, and what happened was she got the 'other' root. All that made me think sqrt(-a) = i*sqrt(a) is not logically true.  I appreciate your discussion, and think it helps. I have long understood that the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers (just set b=0 in complex number (a + bi)), but wondered what restrictions the complete number system (the so-called complex numbers; not to deny yet more complex number systems that exist) places on the integer and rational  exponent properties we learned for the real numbers.  Can you explain why it is when we are working with complex numbers that makes what you said true in the complex number system, i.e., sqrt(-x) = i*sqrt(x) = sqrt(-1) * sqrt(x) if x positive real?",4532,825,1361895737

If you go to page 286, you will see why they say why it is not true that $$\sqrt{-a}\sqrt{-b} = \sqrt{-a \cdot -b}$$.  If we could do that then since $$4 = - (-4)$$ I could conclude that

$$2 = \sqrt{4} = \sqrt{-(-4)} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-4} = i\sqrt{-4} = i \cdot 2i = 2 \cdot i^2 = -2$$

And this is clearly not true.  This somewhat answers your last question also.  Working in the complex number system we can factor out exactly one $$-1$$ from $$\sqrt{-x}$$ (as long as $$x$$ is positive).  But only one!  Because I could always right $$x$$ as $$-(-x)$$ or even $$-(-(-(-x)))$$ etc, and then I would end up with some crazy answers like above.  Does that clear some stuff up?

2624473,"Hi Susana
I think this was the 4th question in Wk4 Quiz 2.  The video that explains how to solve this type of question is titled 'Solving a quadratic equation - Completing the square'. To solve this equation you need to take the following steps.
Step 1.  Move the 4 to the RHS of the quation. 9*x^2+9*x = 4.
Step 2. Make the coefficient of the squared term equal to 1.  
This means you need to divide each term by 9.  Now the equation becomes x^2 +x = 4/9.
Step 3. Take half of the coefficient of the x term and square it.
The coefficient of x is 1 (as there is no number in front of it), so half of 1 is 1/2.  When squared this value becomes 1/4 i.e. 1/2 * 1/2.
Step 4.  Add the value of 1/4 to both sides of the equation. 
Now the equation becomes x^2 + x + 1/4 = 4/9 + 1/4
Step 5. Complete the square - the equation is in the form (A+B)^2.
(x + 1/2)^2 = (16+9)/36 The RHS of the equation - need to add the fractions together.
(x+1/2)^2 = 25/36
Step 6. Take square root of both sides.
x + 1/2 = +/- sqrt(25)/sqrt(36)
x + 1/2 = 5/6 or x+1/2 = -5/6
Now solve for x by having x only on one side of the equation.
I'll leave it at this for now.  See how you go.
The video has examples on how to go through it.",4580,726,1361921893

A: Because 31 OCT = 25 DEC.

A doctor, a civil engineer and a programmer are discussing whose profession is the oldest.
“Surely medicine is the oldest profession,” says the doctor. “God took a rib from Adam and created Eve and if this isn’t medicine I’ll be…”
The civil engineer breaks in:
“But before that He created the heavens and the earth from chaos. Now that’s civil engineering to me.”
The programmer thinks a bit and then says:
“And who do you think created chaos?”

You find the slope, just like you have, then use the point-slope formula, and move stuff around so that you end up with your answer in the standard slope-intercept form.  But, perhaps you have the answer correct, and the syntax is off.  Make sure you're using an * between the slope and x, and also make sure you are not typing in y=.

For #5, first take the linear equation given and move stuff around so you have only y on one side (standard slope-intercept form).  You'll then see the slope of this line.  Remember that a perpendicular line's slope, when multiplied by the original line, will = -1.  So, take the slope of the original line, multiply it by a variable, and set that equal to -1 to get the perpendicular line's slope.  Now that you have this new line's slope, and one of its points, again use the point-slope formula, move stuff around until it's in standard slope-intercept form, and there ya go.  Pay attention to the same syntax rules as #2.

You are absolutely correct in this logic; I also felt the same way until I read a thread; where a man explained this further, but I can't seem to find it. So in this case, we have to go by the video in example 2, from 3:34 to 4:13, where she explained how the square root of +25 couldn't equal to -5 since the square root is a +5.

2657380,"Like many, I thought that the expression to the right was introducing new variables to solve for (namely, k, r, s, and t).  It isn't. For each question, they just want you to give the value of the number in the analogous place on the left side of the equation.  So for ""r"", they want whatever the final exponential value of z is ( which will be ((z^(-2 - 5))^-2).  For k, just determine the value of the rational numbers on the left (namely, the only things that aren't variables and aren't exponents: ((4/6)^-2)). 

Note whether the variable on the right is in the denominator or the numerator, however, since it determines whether your exponent is positive or negative.  For instance, if you solve for y's exponent (which is ""t"") on the left and come up with y^-4, you might think that the question will accept -4 as an answer (since y^-4 is the same as 1/y^4, and t's position on the right is in the denominator).  But it won't.  It wants the number as it would appear in the denominator, so t must equal 4.  If you put in -4 in the equation interprets your answer as 1/y^-4, which is incorrect.

I am sure there is some mathematical shorthand to describe questions like this, where they are just looking for values in analogous positions, but it sure wasn't in the video lecture and I have not found it yet in the reading.  A quick example prior to the start of the quiz would have saved me (and many others) a great deal of wasted time.

2273816,"Hi Stan,

I'll try to explain this problem a bit better, and I'll get to union last.

So we have a function. For a function to be properly defined, we need its domain, its range and its property.

1. **Domain** - a set of all x values for which the function can have a solution in the real numbers set

2. **Range** - a set of all solution that function can give

3. **Property** - a property by which the x values get their y values (an equation, inequality, etc.)

We have the property defined and we need to find the domain. Our domain is just a set of x values. But, not all x-values - only those for which we can get a y value. By looking at the defined property, our x values are the ones that are (by first condition) greater or equal to 3, **and** the ones that are (by second condition) anything other than 5.

The catch here is that **both** conditions have to apply. Therefore, x cannot be, for example, -4 because even though it's not 5, it's still less than 3, and one of our conditions is for x to be greater than or equal to 3.

Now, the union is just used to mathematically write down our interval of x values. So your interval is not from - infinity because numbers less than 3 don't come into play.",4823,859,1362519086

1451765,"Dr, Eichhorn mentions the ""square root function"" and says that that function is defined to be greater than or equal to zero, meaning that numbers the square root function outputs are always greater than or equal to zero. If you have a graphing calculator you can easily see this, as the curve is all in the first quadrant. Be aware that if you try to take the square root of a negative number, you cannot get an answer because it would be complex, and we are working with real numbers only, for purposes of this discussion. Except for complex numbers, it makes no sense to take the square root of a negative number (-b)(-b) = b^2, and (b)(b) = b^2. My graphing calculator is strictly working with real numbers when I get the curve I mentioned. I can set the mode to complex and then it is different. You should ignore the complex side here.

Your answer:   When taking the square root of a real number, the answer will be positive AND the x input to the function must be positive. You are not allowed to take the square root of a negative number, at this point.

However, as Dr. Einhhorn shows in her examples, if you put x^2 into the square root function, you should know that you are looking for both the positive and negative roots. The same goes when you are given an expression like  x^2 = 9 and asked to solve it. You should give the two answers plus and minus 3. These are deviations from the standard that says you always give the positive square root as an answer. And so is the quadratic formula a similar deviation.",4851,866,1362595179

    Thank you for your input.  Signs were not my problem, and since you kindly worked out the beginning, I see what I did different, and I still don't know if it's incorrect or correct procedure.  you have the part f(x)= f(x+h) you have a formula involving x  and -x^2 value for the problem.  According to my interpretation of binomial expansion, I set it up this way.
-x*(x+h)^2 expands to -x^3-2*x^2*h-x*h^2 see, I was thinking that you have to include the x given in the equation and multiply that by the formula (x+h) to whatever power given.  That gives the -x^3 which was one of the terms left over, I'll try it your way and see how it works out.  My way does not, but I still think you have to include the -x given to be correct in procedure as above -x(x+h)^2.  In other words even though you move the exponent to outside the grouped parenthesis, you still have the -x left that must be multiplied.  Hope I am making myself clear.  Bill",5037,943,1363041762

    Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, my internet was down due to a server failure.  Let me try again to explain what I saw.  To me, negative x squared is not a like term with x in (x+h)  You can move the exponent to the right above the parenthesis, but you are still left with negative x.  Hence, -x^2 to (x+h) = -x*(x+h)^2.  Expand  -x * x^2 = - x^3 -2*x^2*h-x*h^2 expanded.  To me, -x and x are not the same, you took away the exponent and moved it to the right, but you cannot combine or drop the negative x.  It just can't go away.  It would if it was positive.  Make any sense?  For some reason, in the back of my mind I remember this from college Algebra in 1970.  But, I'm probably hallucinating.  The answer has the correct terms in it, just too many.  I will try your way tomorrow.  Thanks, Bill ",5037,943,1363065445

I can appreciate your wanting to refresh your memory on algebra. I had last taken a course in algebra in 1972, so we have a similar desire to reacquaint ourselves with the subject.

I do think, however, that your approach won't work. The x in f(x) is more or less a placeholder for numbers that can go into the function. I hope a numeric example will convince you that the use of x+h in the function should be treated in the same way as if we used x.

Using the function f(x)=-x^2, let's first use x=3, That will give us f(3)=-(3)^2=-9. Now let's try 5 in the function. f(5)-(5)^2=-25. But isn't 5=3+2? So f(3+2)=-(3+2)^2=-(5)^2=-25. The 3 can be represented by the x we had before (x=3) and the 2 can be represented by the variable h (h=2). The point is that you need not treat x+h any differently in a function than you would treat x in the same function. Treating the inputs to a function differently is what you appear to be doing in this problem, which will not get you to the correct answer to the question on the quiz.",5037,943,1363093680

Remember that ""("" and "")"" are non inclusive while ""["" and ""]"" are inclusive. I haven't checked the values themselves (and won't). 
One note: the ""+"" on ""+\inf"" is unneeded. A sign is only required for ""-\inf"".  
On the next question.. again, without checking the actual numbers, you will need to explicitly specify the multiplications in the equation. In your example it would be  ""-4*(u^2)+(6*u)+4"". If you are unsure of what order things will be evaluated in, use parenthesis to group terms together.  
 More parenthesis are usually better than less. Example:
the same could be written as ""((-(4))*((u)^(2))+((6)*(u))+(4))"".

Or you can use LaTeX directly in the comment box to produce the symbol. To get what you want you must type two US dollar signs, then a backslash, followed by three alpha characters ""cap"", followed by two more dollar signs (the dollar signs signal what's contained inside is to be interpreted as math), and it should display the logical symbol for INTERSECTION as:  $$\cap$$ which is the upside down U. Better than the keyboard U, you can input the actual logic symbol for UNION, the rightside up U, by the same LaTeX math structure, but after the backslash put the characters ""cup"". That's what I have done here: $$\cup$$, the regular symbol for UNION.

Well in this case, since you have a fraction and you can factor a -1 out of both numerator and denominator, the -1's will cancel each other out.  You would have not been able to do that if you had -x-3 on top and a PLUS 4 on the bottom.  Another example is like you mentioned above where you have a linear equation and you multiply both sides by -1 (which I like to do if I end up with a negative x...seeing negatives just drive me nuts).  I'm sure there are others, but if you just follow the age old rule ""what you do to one side, do to the other"" or ""what you do to the numerator, do to the denominator"", you'll be fine.

Then you will notice that you have in the denominator, an expression that contains a square root. That isn't allowed, according to that video. You have to RATIONALIZE the denominator, where the square root represents an irrational number, so you have to get rid of it. You do that by multiplying your simplified problem by 1. . . meaning by a fractional expression with the numerator and denominator equal (x/x=1), but the x here will be the CONJUGATE of the denominator of your problem, which means, say, if you have square root of 3 minus 4 in the denominator of the problem, you want to multiply it by 1=conjugate/conjugate, where the conjugate is the same with the internal sign changed (say, if your denominator is 3√−4, your conjugate is 3√+4), so you multiply your problem by the fraction 3√+4 divided by 3√+4.",5326,992,1363626147

First try a number that is less than -5, such as Andy's suggestion of -6 and see if the inequality still holds. If it does not, then anything less than -5 cannot be a part of the solution set. Then try a number in between -5 and 3, such as 0, and see if the inequality holds for that value. If not, then numbers in between -5 and 3 are not a part of the solution set either. But if the inequality does hold for x=0, then you can be reasonably assured that all of the number between -5 and 3 do belong to the solution set. Finally, try a number that is larger than 3, perhap 4 or 5 or whatever number you care to use. If that number does not satisfy the inequality, then no number larger than 3 will satisfy the inequality.

I had a similar confusion over the definition of the ""principal"" square root, all the while admitting plus and minus roots this or that, at special places, such as the quadratic formula and taking the square root of x squared. Bottom line, you are exactly right in saying that mathematicians don't or can't agree about everything, and I need to force myself to make room for that because that is only being realistic. When you think about it, they could never ALL be in perfect agreement at the same time, else the field of mathematics would have been completely exhausted, all dried out.

And it really sucks when you learn one instructors language one semester and you get a new instructor who's language contradicts the previous instructor in many minor but important points.

I guess the major difference between Intermediate Algebra and Pre-Calc is that Pre-Calc covers several more function types than Algebra. Exponential/Logarithmic, Trig etc. Calculus involves these functions as well and you have to be comfortable working with them as well as polynomials. I've found the Pre-Calc class to be a good refresher but you'd really have to do all of the outside readings and problems they assign to really learn Trig and the other types of functions it covers.

We have actually covered Algebra in a bit more detail in this class. I did all of my original math studies back in the early 60's to early 70's and a lot has changed so I'm learning new bits and pieces which weren't in math curricula when I was in school. But I did learn the basics and you have to really know the basics to be successful in Calculus.

I'm doing pretty much what you are, but my goal is to get a complete math reeducation so I can read modern physics and EE with understanding. So I will look forward to rebuilding the trig and log materials after this course. It's ok to spend that time; it will be a good investment; I can do with a lot more practice and time to think about what I am doing.

I learned how much more I needed to learn back when I read Roger Penrose's wonderful book Road to Reality. In that book he casts bread crumbs to outline a pathway through the modern mathematical jungle, showing readers what is needed to understand in mathematics in order to be able to understand today's writers. I was simply amazed with how much I really don't know all that well AND how interesting those areas of math described by Penrose look (to me). I read his thousand page book twice, and there is no hope for me to understand anything unless I get a complete retread!  Fortunately, I am getting quite a lot that I didn't expect from this course. I attempt every problem assigned, and not always successfully. Thanks so much for explaining what's next, and sharing your experiences.

BTW:  I've sent a request to Rod of the MathIsFun website, asking why he doesn't admit max and min points in his regions of ""strictly increasing"" curves, explaining that my mission is not to have him change, that I merely would like to know his rationale, but that our course and text make no distinction between increasing and strictly increasing functions, and they include the max/min points.

1528573,"Hi Gina and anyone still stuck on this question;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; At the risk of flogging a dead horse, and after reading some of the other posts on this question, I think I see the rub some students are experiencing with this problem, at the end. &nbsp;Rewrite the original to an equivalent expression. &nbsp;<br />(x+5)/(x-3)-x/(x+1)=0 factor out to -(( x+5)/(x^2-2*x-3))=0 &nbsp;multiply both sides by the common denominator x^2-2*x-3 and your left with -(x+5)=0 &nbsp;here is the rub I think, remove the parenthesis move =to x and distribute the sign, you have x= -5 some students have been saying they are left with -x and think they need to include -\inf, no x= -5 period. If you substitute -5 back into the simplified form numerator (x+5) this would be (-5+5) which of course, equals zero. With zero in the numerator and a number in the denominator, if you divide you get zero. &nbsp;That's ok, so since &lt; or = to [-5 is part of the answer. &nbsp;bracket for inclusion. &nbsp;If you remember the video on Rational inequalities our instructor's example, she used the additive inverse values in the denominator as plug ins. Here, the numerator values -3 and 1, the additive inverses are 3, and -1 however here as in the video, their values equal zero in the denominator and division by zero is not defined. Including the values would then have an open parenthesis. &nbsp;If you make a table of values and graph this function, -5 is the only place crossed on the x axis. &nbsp;I hope I hit everyone's itchy spot with this problem.<br /><br />",5805,1049,1364840875

1451765,"Ryan, I really appreciate your taking the time to check this out for me. I found it confusing, but I can now see that your recommendation is appropriate. Examples of this are piling up (well, not THAT bad, but some have popped up). One is the definition of the set of natural numbers, something that an outsider would probably consider insane when first discovering that any given teacher/mathematician would maintain one (ONE AND ONLY ONE) of two different definitions (i.e., with and without zero), considering the set of natural numbers so fundamental that there really ought not be any disagreement. I like the one where certain teachers adopt the (some might call it useless) form of placing an X^0 next to the constant term of a polynomial, and/or in a sequence like x^3, x^2, x^1, x^0, x^-1, x^-2, etc, to make explicit what might be missed if not done that way. Another is the difference between multiplying an inequality through by minus 1, and taking the LOGICAL NEGATION. They both ""flip"" the inequality signs, but that's all that is done by multiplication. The Logical negation not only ""flips"" the inequality signs, but forces the number line to be continuous (meaning NOT greater than becomes less than or equal, NOT less than or equal becomes greater than. These are things a studend ought to be at least warned about up front, like the reason that the ""principal square root"" was defined. That would be better than letting all students run into these things on their own, ALWAYS. &nbsp;But I am not aiming this at you because you have done your absolute best to help students learn what is going on and we all appreciate your help.",5864,984,1365024662

2461522,"Bill, thank you I'm glad I can help. &nbsp;I think the reason some things may not to explained to the student (at first) is because there are a lot of intricacies going on and all the information could overwhelm. &nbsp;It is really nice to see you having all these questions though, and trust me, everything will start to clear up. &nbsp;One thing that I think is important to note is that the idea that mathematics always has ""one true answer"" is a bit misleading. &nbsp;It should be stated more like ""there is a one answer *based on your assumptions*"". &nbsp;This includes definitions and axioms and previous theorems. &nbsp;So mathematician A may say that the set of natural numbers does not include $$0$$ and prove the theorem ""there is no natural number before $$1$$"", which is of course true. &nbsp;On the other hand, mathematician B says the set of natural numbers includes $$0$$ and obviously that theorem is wrong. &nbsp;Does that mean the statement is inherently wrong? No! &nbsp;It just means in one context or ""universe"" it is interpreted to be true, and in another universe it is interpreted to be false. &nbsp;Mathematics is like this a lot. &nbsp;There is an answer, but it is not always universal, it is universal up to the assumptions you have made.<br /><br />As for the negation, and multiplying by $$-1$$, I wouldn't think of those as the same operation. &nbsp;Multiplying by $$-1$$ is simply an algebraic operation with certain rules. &nbsp;The logical negation of (strictly) less than $$5$$ is greater than or equal to $$5$$ and so we want that to be modeled in the symbols.<br /><br />In regards to the principal root thing, as you pointed out in the earlier post, its really because we want $$\sqrt$$ to be a function, and that means a unique value for each input. &nbsp;(This is what I was trying to get at, with my old posts about uniqueness, without saying we want it to be a function because I thought that might be more confusing.

The good news about math is that it doesn't become obsolete.

2268385,"Thanks, Arthur, for your very thoughtful response. I agree that a midterm would have greatly&nbsp;improved student experience without sacrificing rigor--it would just have relieved unnecessary&nbsp;testing anxiety. I did pass, but on the second attempt, and largely because I had a list of my correct answers from the first time to enter quickly, where possible, plus corrections of those problems I had missed. This sort of gaming should be unnecessary, however, and&nbsp;calls into question the sufficiency of&nbsp;2.5 hours for 35 questions. As others have remarked, the timing challenge was exacerbated by the&nbsp;clunky, counter-intuitive&nbsp;software interface. I'd gotten use to it&nbsp;for quizzes, but found it intrusive on the final.<br /><br /> On balance, though, I very much enjoyed this course.

Partial attempts should be reversed due to this lack of clarification. This would not give those that had a connectivity issue an unfair advantage as any partial attempt that was a result of disconnection was simply a partial attempt. Those that had a partial attempt missed the opportunity to work out every problem type first and identify weaknesses before another attempt. Everyone should have the opportunity to solve each problem type at least once before taking the final exam, and if there were extenuating circumstances that prevented them from doing so, exceptions should be made. These exceptions could be easily identified by verifying the attempts that consisted of mostly unanswered problems.",6034,1142,1365374099
1451765,"All along I have been doing the quesitions on the quizzes with time to think about them, so did SO &nbsp;well on all of them that I hadn't thought about what the TIME element would do to my feeling of being proud of learning. Then I took the FINAL, and because of the TIME element, I made numerous errors that were simply stupid mistakes that were almost entirely driven by the clock. It made me nervous, so I choked, I guess. But there were INPUT errors this time that were always corrctable prior to this. After it was over I found that there were exactly TWO issues that I didn't understand fully, and deserved to have gotten them wrong. BUT I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR THE COURSERA PEOPLE.<br /><br />Since the object is to learn, and since students who have hung around to the end, supposedly were here to learn, I think the following might be reasonable as a better way to approach this DISTANCE LEARNING project, such that it doesn't turn off future students.<br /><br />Ok:<br /><br />1) give the final exam a little more time, say half an hour extra<br />2) then make the exam a two stage process, the initial exam, followed immediately by an hour during which each student has the missed questions in front of them to edit and correct problems they either got wrong because they had answers that were basically correct, but the input mechanism couldn't deal with anything but END POINTS OF A COMPLEX CHAIN OF CALCULATIONS AND THINKING.<br /><br />If you did this, it would certainly help people who were diligently doing all of the work during the semester, and had worked &nbsp;the problems basically correctly, except for some little problem. If you put the shoe on your own foot, you might be able to see what I am talking about. My final score does not reflect all that I learned in this class. If I didn't actually learn how to solve all of those problems, how could I go back and make them correct in a single additional hour. The way I learn these topics, it takes about an hour per topic on a good day. No body would be GETTING AWAY WITH ANYTHING.",6038,1161,1365374265

1451765,"THANKS TO ALL OF THE UC IRVINE PEOPLE INVOLVED!<br /><br />To assist you in evaluating how well YOU did respecting the final exam, I did a thorough review of my exam errors and want to report to you a ""student's eye view"" of how it went from my personal perspective.<br /><br />Waiting until the last day or so to do the final was a bad idea. At the end I was totally exhausted from doing the exam twice on a day I started out reviewing. Not only exhaustion, but there was another problem related to how you conducted the two phased final exam.<br /><br />The second time taking the final I had printed out the results of the first (27 pages), to see if any of the problems were going to be the same, and that ended up causing another problem. Of the five problems I missed, two of them I actually worked the OLD problem all over again, reading the printout, rather than the new final exam problem, cause I was so tired. Two more were wrong simply because I rushed. And the last was a transcription error from my worksheet to the input, dropped a minus sign.<br /><br />FOR ALL FIVE PROBLEMS I MISSED I KNEW HOW TO EASILY SOLVE THEM, GIVEN ENOUGH TIME AND FRESHNESS!<br /><br />My second take experience makes me even more convinced that my earlier proposal (in my comment above) would be a benefit to the COURSERA enterprise. It is a problem gving a second take opportunity when you change some, but not all of the questions (actally, taking a 2 and 1/2 hours exam twice in one day is a problem). It would be so much preferable if you would just let people edit their incorrect answers over a reasonable amount of time immediately following the actual exam. Then the student could fix stupid errors caused by rushing, or improper input, but would not have enough time to be able to LEARN how to solve a problem they had not studied previously.<br /><br />Another reason to adopt my strategy would be that because you don't have the capacity to personally ""grade"" any of the final exams, you default to machine grading, which demands that students only get credit for PERFECT ANSWERS, meaning that YOU don't know whether a student couldn't even figure out how to start a problem , or worked the problem half way through correctly, or worked it all the way through properly, but made a simple typo somewhere in the chain of calculations. All you know is that the student was unable to input a correct solution. By doing it this way, you are not effectively measuring how much of your materials any student learned, but rather, how accustomed they are to the pressures of doing calculations under a tight time limit, and how well they were able to deal with the MMI.<br /><br />For these are the kinds of reasons that DISTANCE LEARNING has ALWAYS failed in the past!<br /><br />Other than those important considerations, I do think all of the people from UC Irvine did an excellent job of presenting the course material in an easily understandable manner, and were generally very fair in the way they conducted the course. The crude input mechanism was not their fault, nonetheless, it absolutely must get fixed.<br /><br />Thanks again to all the staff for a highly enjoyable experience, and my best wishes to them in the future",6099,1161,1365431923

<p>However, if x was a negative number less than -7......for example -8, then you would end up with square root of -1 which is a complex number ( = i sqrt(1))</p>

2711446,"<p>Hi Mary, sorry for getting back to you so late due to the time difference. It&#39;s morning here in South Africa. Regarding your question... I didn&#39;t do the 2nd exam. Perhaps other students can confirm if your answer is correct or not.  I would of begun the problem as Kevin Morgan mentioned above ie: multiply the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator (see how he explained it). However, I think we would of ended up with the same domains as you mentioned... x&gt;=0 and x =/ 81 which in my opinion would give the same interval notation you mentioned as your answer </p>
