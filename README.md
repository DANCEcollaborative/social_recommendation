# Social Recommendation


Recommendation technology for help seeking in Massive Open Online Courses discussion forums implemented using a context-aware Matrix Factorization model to predict students' preferences for answering a given question. MOOC discussion forums need social recommendation which requires the match should be attractive in both directions , i.e., students looking for help could direct thier questions to capable peers and students should be able to find or given questions that match their interests. This recommendation framework allows for this two-way recommendation.
